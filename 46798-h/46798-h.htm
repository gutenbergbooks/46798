<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:—</p>

<p>In my last story, the title of which was “The
Pioneer Boys of Missouri,” I half-promised
that later on I might continue the recital of
Dick and Roger Armstrong’s fortunes, and
carry them further along their pathway toward
the far-distant Pacific. The opportunity to redeem
that promise having been given to me, I
gladly meet you once more in these pages; and I
trust this story will afford you quite as much
pleasure in the reading as I have taken in the
writing.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we left the two
pioneer lads in the winter camp of the Lewis
and Clark exploring party. This company had
been sent out, chiefly through the personal influence
of the President at Washington, to find
a way across the newly-acquired country, and
blaze a path to the Pacific. They had gone into
camp close to the quaint Mandan Indian village,
far up on the Yellowstone River, which stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
they had been following since leaving the Missouri.</p>

<p>Apparently their troubles and difficulties had
all been smoothed away, and there seemed to
be clear sailing ahead for Dick and his cousin.
They anticipated spending the long winter
months in various ways—studying Indian character
and habits, doing more or less hunting and
trapping, and possibly learning if there could
be any real truth in the strange stories they had
heard from numerous sources concerning a
Land of Enchantment that existed near the “Big
Water” at the source of the river of the yellow
rocks and the troubled current.</p>

<p>Unexpected developments, it chanced, caused
the boys to venture into this unknown and mysterious
region, where they met with many adventures
which I have endeavored to narrate in
this volume. It will be seen that, although the
various tribes of Indians inhabiting the Great
Northwest country at that time undoubtedly
knew of the marvels embraced in what is now
Yellowstone Park, a superstitious feeling of awe
for the Evil Spirit’s workings made their visits
to that region few and far between, though their
love for the chase did take them there at times.</p>

<p>I trust that if any of you ever get a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to visit this National Reservation you will do so.
And if you read the history of Yellowstone Park
you will find that perhaps the first authentic
account of its astonishing wonders was given
to the world by a member of the Lewis and
Clark expedition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE YOUNG EXPLORERS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I think</span> we have gone far enough from the
camp, Roger.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Dick. I never seem to
know when to stop, once I get started.”</p>

<p>“And it’s easy to start you, too. That was
why the boys, back at the settlement of St.
Louis, came to call you ‘Headstrong Roger.’”</p>

<p>“Well, Dick, I hope to outgrow that fault in
time. You know my father was the same way,
when he and Uncle Bob used to hunt and trap
and fish on the Ohio River, and later along the
Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“It seems hard to believe, Roger, that we are
so far from our homes. Sometimes I shut my
eyes and can picture all the dear ones again—father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
mother, and my younger brother,
Sam.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but here we are, hundreds and hundreds
of miles from them, and in the heart of
the Western wilderness,” said the boy who had
been called Roger; “and planning to spend the
coming winter with our good friends Captain
Lewis and Captain Clark.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” remarked his companion, “I
am sorry we determined to stay here and winter
near the Mandan Indian village. We might
have turned back and gone home, along with
the messengers who were dispatched with documents
for the President at Washington.”</p>

<p>“And who also carried the precious paper
that Jasper Williams signed, which will save
our parents’ homes from being taken away from
them by that scheming French trader, Lascelles.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” observed Dick, thoughtfully,
“when I think of the wonderful things we have
seen, and what a glorious chance we have of
setting eyes on the great Pacific Ocean next
summer, I am glad we decided to stay up here
on this strange river of the wilderness that in
the Indian tongue means Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“It is a different stream from the ‘Big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Muddy’ or the Missouri, and as full of rapids
as it can be. Before long the expedition will
have to abandon all boats, and trust to the
horses to carry the camp outfit over the mountains
to the west.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Roger, what was that sound?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was the whinny of a horse,” replied
the impetuous one of the pair, as they
dropped behind some brush that grew on the
brow of a gradual slope leading to a lower level.</p>

<p>“And it came from below us, too. What
could a horse be doing here? Do you think any
of our men are out after fresh meat to-day?”</p>

<p>“There are a few horses among some of the
Indian tribes around here, and it might be—there,
look, something is coming yonder, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Don’t move again, Roger; it is an Indian
brave, and there follows another, treading in
his trail.”</p>

<p>“They are not of our friends, the Mandans,
Dick, and they don’t look like the Sioux we met
a while ago. There come three more, and now
I can see the horse!”</p>

<p>“H’sh! Not a whisper now, and lie as still
as a rock. They have sharp eyes, even if they
are not on the warpath.”</p>

<p>Roger knew why his cousin made this last remark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for the horse was dragging two poles
after him, the ends of which trailed on the
ground. Upon this primitive wagon rested
quite a pile of stuff, evidently the skin teepee
of the family and other articles, as well as a
buxom squaw and a small papoose.</p>

<p>Back of the first horse came a second, similarly
equipped, and then another tall, half-naked
brave, armed with bow and arrows.
Dick knew that the little procession was a portion
of some Indian community moving their
camp to a place where the game would be more
abundant, for this was the season when they
laid in their winter store of jerked venison or
“pemmican.”</p>

<p>“Don’t move yet, Roger,” whispered Dick,
after the last figure had gone some little distance
along the trail; “I believe there is another
party coming. Yes, I can already see them a
little way back there. Just crouch down and
watch.”</p>

<p>While the two boys are lying hidden, and
waiting for the passage of the hostile Indians,
belonging to some tribe with which they hitherto
had had no dealings, we might take advantage
of the opportunity to ascertain just
who Dick and Roger Armstrong are, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
they could be doing in this unknown region, far
back in 1804, when the headwaters of the Missouri
had never been fully explored by any
white man.</p>

<p>Many years previous to this time their grandfather,
David Armstrong, had emigrated from
Virginia to the banks of the Ohio, being
tempted to take this step because of wonderful
stories concerning that country told to him by
his good friend, the famous pioneer, Daniel
Boone.</p>

<p>His family consisted of three children, a girl
and two boys, Bob and Sandy. The brothers
grew up versed in woods lore, as did all border
boys. They knew all about the secrets of the
great forest and the mighty waters. And, indeed,
in those days, with peril constantly hovering
over their heads, it was essential that
boys should learn how to handle a rifle as soon
as they could lift one of the long-barreled weapons
to their shoulder.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Later, the pioneer was tempted to continue
still further into the Golden West, always with
the rainbow of promise luring him onward toward
the setting sun. With other families, the
Armstrongs drifted down the beautiful Ohio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and finally settled on the Missouri, above the
trading post of St. Louis.</p>

<p>Here the two sturdy lads grew to manhood,
married, and built cabins of their own, near that
of old David and his wife. To Bob came two
boys, Dick and Sam; while his brother had a
son, Roger, and a sweet girl named Mary, after
her grandmother.</p>

<p>These two cousins, Dick and Roger, hunted
in company, and were as fond of one another
as their fathers had been. Dick was a little
the older, and acted as a sort of safety valve
upon the more impulsive Roger; but both
learned the lessons of Nature, day by day, until,
at the time we make their acquaintance in this
volume, they were capable of meeting the craftiness
of the Indian, or the fury of the forest wild
beast, with equal cunning.</p>

<p>On the previous spring there had fallen a
bombshell into the happy homes of the Armstrongs
near the thriving settlement named
after the French king. When David, on his
arrival years before, had purchased a large section
of land that was bound to grow very valuable
for his heirs in later years, he had believed
his title to be clear and unquestioned.</p>

<p>Later, it turned out that a certain signature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was lacking to make the title valid, and unless
this could be obtained within a certain time from
an heir of the original owners, the entire tract
would be taken from them. An unscrupulous
French trader, named François Lascelles, had
secured the opposing claim, and threatened to
evict the Armstrongs in the coming spring, unless
they could produce that valuable signature.</p>

<p>This impending family trouble affected Dick
and Roger greatly. They began to make investigations
and learned that the man whose
signature was wanted, Jasper Williams by
name, a hunter and trapper, was then far away
in the unknown regions of the West.</p>

<p>They also learned that this forest ranger expected
to join an exploring party headed by
two men who had recently been in St. Louis,
and whom they had met in company with their
grandfather, David Armstrong. These were
Captain Lewis and Captain Clark, sent out by
the President of the United States to learn what
lay far beyond the Mississippi Valley, and possibly
to proceed all the way to the Pacific Ocean,
which was known to lie hundreds, perhaps thousands
of miles west of the Mississippi Valley.
(<a id="Note_1r"></a><a href="#Note_1">Note 1</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>So, determined to do everything in their
power to get that paper signed by the one man
whose name would save their homes, Dick and
Roger had finally gained the consent of their
parents to their making the perilous trip.</p>

<p>Many weary weeks the boys followed after the
expedition, which had had quite a start ahead of
them. They met with strange vicissitudes and
wonderful adventures by the way, yet through
it all their courage and grim determination carried
them safely, so that in the end they finally
reached the little company of bold spirits forging
ahead through this unknown land.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>They were received with kindness by the two
captains, who admired the spirit that had
brought these lads through so many difficulties.</p>

<p>In the end the valuable signature was attached
to the paper, which was placed in charge of a
special messenger whom Captain Lewis was
sending, with two other men, to carry reports of
the progress of the expedition to the President,
who had great faith in the enterprise.</p>

<p>This messenger had instructions to proceed
straight to St. Louis, first of all, and deliver the
document to David Armstrong before heading
for Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys had yielded to the invitation of their
new friends to remain with the expedition in
camp through the approaching winter, and continue
on in the spring to the great ocean that
all believed lay beyond the mountain barrier.
Such a chance would never come to them again in
all their lives. The document would reach the
hands of the home folks in due time, and also
the letters they had dispatched with it.</p>

<p>And so it is that we find Dick and Roger off on
a little exploring trip on a day when the chill
winds told of the winter that was soon to wrap
all the land in an icy mantle.</p>

<p>They huddled there in security behind the
thick brush, and, by peeping through little openings,
could watch all that went on below them.
The moving Indians interested them greatly, because
they apparently belonged to a tribe with
which the boys, until then, had had no intercourse;
although Dick guessed, from the style of
head-dress of the warriors, that in all probability
they were Blackfeet, and not Crows.</p>

<p>At any rate, he did not like their looks, and
felt that it would be a serious thing for himself
and his companion if by any accident they attracted
the attention of the passing party.
Even if they were not just then on the warpath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
they possessed arms, and might consider a white
intruder on their hunting grounds as a bitter
enemy, who should be exterminated at any cost.</p>

<p>The second detachment had now come along
and was passing by. It consisted of several
braves, and another horse dragging the poles
upon which a squaw and three dark-faced Indian
papooses sat amidst the camp equipage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Roger, in his eagerness to see a
little better, when something especially attracted
his attention, chanced to make a hasty move,
with the result that he dislodged quite a good-sized
stone, which started down the slope, gathering
speed as it went.</p>

</div>
<hr class="chap" /><div class='chapter-beginning'>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>SAVED BY A JACK-RABBIT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first, the stone seemed satisfied to merely
slide downward, so that Dick hoped it would
lodge in some crevice and not be noticed by any
of the passing Indians. This hope was short-lived,
however, for, gaining momentum as the
slope grew steeper, the stone began to skip and
jump, until, bursting through a little patch of
dead grass, it attracted the attention of the
nearest brave.</p>

<p>Dick heard him utter a guttural exclamation,
and, at the same time saw him hastily reach for
his bow, which was slung over his shoulder.
The others, too, manifested immediate interest
in the bounding stone, for such things do not
roll down a slope without some cause and there
were red enemies of their tribe who often lay in
hiding to attack them.</p>

<p>Roger gave a gasp of dismay. That was not
the first time he had been guilty of bringing
some sort of trouble upon the heads of himself
and his cousin. Dick laid his hand on the arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the impetuous one, and his low-whispered
“Be still” doubtless prevented Roger from
making matters worse by showing himself
above the bush that sheltered them.</p>

<p>It would seem as though some good cherub
aloft must have interposed to save the two lads
from the peril which confronted them. Even
as they lay there and stared, they saw one of
the Indians point at something a little further
along the slope, and then, strange to say, the
procession again resumed its forward movement,
as though all suspicion had been allayed.</p>

<p>Roger was almost bursting with curiosity to
know what had intervened. He had not been
able to see, because Dick chanced to be on that
side of him and, much as he wanted to stretch
his neck and look, he dared not attempt it after
what had happened.</p>

<p>Accordingly they lay perfectly still until the
last of the Indians had disappeared in the distance.
Even then Dick would not start to leave
their hiding place until absolutely sure no others
were coming along the trail.</p>

<p>Unable to longer restrain the overpowering
curiosity that gripped him, Roger presently put
the question that was burning on his tongue.</p>

<p>“What was it happened to make them pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by, and not start up here to see how that stone
started to roll down?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t see the jack-rabbit, Roger?”</p>

<p>“A rabbit, you say, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was the most fortunate thing that
could have happened for us, and we ought to be
thankful to the little beast that he took it in his
head to skip out when that stone jumped through
the patch of dead grass where he was hiding.”</p>

<p>“Oh! was that what happened?” exclaimed
the other boy, chuckling now because of the
lucky event. “And, of course, when the Indians
saw the rabbit running off, they believed it had
started the stone to falling. It sometimes seems
to me as if we were guarded by some invisible
power, we have so many wonderful escapes!”</p>

<p>“It may be that we are, Roger, because we
know that not a day passes but that our mothers,
far away down the Missouri, are praying that
we may be spared to come back to them. But,
now that the coast is clear, let us head once more
for Fort Mandan, as we call our camp.”</p>

<p>Of course both these wide-awake lads knew
how to find their way through the densest woods,
or over unknown ground, by using their knowledge
of woodcraft to tell them the cardinal
points of the compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sky was clear, they could find the
north by means of the sun, moon, or some of the
stars. If clouds obscured their vision, they
knew how to discover the same fact through the
moss on the trees, or even the thickness of the
bark. Besides the methods mentioned, there
were others that experience and association
with other rovers of the woods had taught
them.</p>

<p>Consequently, although they might be traversing
country that neither of them had ever set
eyes on before, they always knew just which
way to head in order to reach camp.</p>

<p>Dick was constantly taking mental notes as he
went along. These included not only the prospects
for game, but the lay of the land, for Captain
Lewis wished to know all that was possible
about such things before once more starting out
in the spring to complete his great trip to the
Western Sea.</p>

<p>At the same time, Dick was also on the alert
for every sign of danger, from whatever source.
His keen vision took in all that went on around
him. Not a leaf rustled to the ground, as some
passing breeze loosened its hold on the branch
above, but he saw it eddying through the air;
never a little ground squirrel frisked behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
some lichen-covered rock, or tree root, that Dick
did not instantly note.</p>

<p>They presently found themselves traversing
what seemed to be a rough belt of rocky land,
where the trees were not very plentiful. It was
even difficult at times to advance, and they had
to be careful where they placed their feet, since
a fall might result in serious bruises.</p>

<p>Just as they passed around a huge bowlder,
that had at some time fallen from the face of
the cliff towering above them, the two boys
heard a queer, sniffing sound. Before either had
time to draw back, there came shuffling into
view, not more than fifty feet beyond them, a
terrifying figure such as they had never up to
that moment set eyes upon.</p>

<p>It was a huge bear, far larger than any they
had met with in all their hunting trips along the
Missouri. From some of the hunters connected
with the exploring party they had heard the
wildest stories concerning a monster species of
brown, or grizzly bear that was said to have its
home amidst the rocky dens of the mountains
and foothills lying to the west. The Indians
always spoke of this animal as though it were to
be dreaded more than any creature of the wilds.
The brave who could produce the long claws of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
grizzly bear was immediately honored with the
head feathers of a chief.</p>

<p>Dick knew, therefore, that they were now facing
one of these terrible animals. He could well
understand the awe with which they were viewed
by the red men, and the half-breed trappers, for
the appearance of this monster was certainly
alarming. Perhaps, if left to his own device,
the more cautious Dick might have considered it
best for them to decline a combat and, if the bear
did not attack them, they could withdraw and
seek a safer trail across the rocky ridge.</p>

<p>In figuring on this course, however, he failed
to count on the impetuous nature of his companion.
The hunter-instinct was well developed in
Roger. He looked upon nearly everything that
walked on four feet and carried a coat of fur as
his legitimate prize, if only he could succeed in
placing a bullet where it would do the most
good.</p>

<p>So it came about that, as Dick started to put
out his hand with the intention of drawing his
comrade back, he was startled to hear the crash
of a gun close to his ear. Roger had instinctively
thrown his weapon to his shoulder, and,
with quick aim, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions Roger was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
clever marksman. There were times, however,
when he failed to exercise the proper care, and
then he was apt to make a poor shot. That may
have happened in the present instance; or else,
it must be true, as the Indians said, that the
grizzly bear could carry off more lead, or survive
more arrows, than any other living creature.</p>

<p>Dick was shocked to see that, instead of falling
over as the shot rang out, the great bear
started toward them, roaring, and acting as
though rendered furious by the wound he had received.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but that Dick should
try to complete the tragedy. He aimed as best
he could, considering the fact that the animal
was now moving swiftly, if clumsily, in their direction,
and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>His rifle was always kept well primed and the
powder did not simply flash in the pan; but he
realized at once that he had not given the monster
his death wound, for the bear still advanced,
displaying all the symptoms of rage.</p>

<p>“We must get out of this, Roger!” cried Dick,
for, as it would be utterly impossible for either
of them to reload in time to meet the oncoming
beast, they must either escape, or else engage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a terrible fight with their knives at close
quarters.</p>

<p>The remembrance of the long, sharp claws he
had seen around the neck of the Sioux chief,
Running Elk, caused Dick to decide on the
former course. As he turned to run, he
dragged Roger with him.</p>

<p>He remembered hearing that these terrible
denizens of the Western mountains could not
climb a tree like their black cousins. To this
fact many a man owed his life, when attacked by
a grizzly bear. As he ran, Dick strained his
eyes to discover a convenient tree into which he
and Roger might climb to safety.</p>

<p>Glancing back over his shoulder when a chance
occurred, he saw, to his dismay, that the
wounded animal was coming after them with a
rush, and evidently had no idea of giving over
the pursuit simply because his two-legged enemies
were retreating.</p>

<p>“What can we do, Dick?” gasped Roger, now
beginning to realize the foolishness of taking
that haphazard shot at such a terrible beast,
against which he had been warned by others who
knew something of its ferocity.</p>

<p>“We must climb a tree, it is our only hope!”
replied the other, between his set teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s one just ahead of us, Dick!” cried
Roger, hopefully.</p>

<p>“We could never get up before the bear
caught us, for there are no limbs low enough to
be easily reached,” Dick answered. “A little
further on I think I can see the one we must
gain. Try to run faster; he is gaining on us,
I’m afraid!”</p>

<p>Both lads were soon breathing heavily, for
they found the uneven nature of the rock-strewn
ground to be very much against them. But,
fortunately, neither chanced to fall, and thus delay
their flight and, while the oncoming grizzly
was yet some little distance in their wake, they
managed to reach the hospitable tree that offered
them hope of a refuge.</p>

<p>“Up as fast as you can, Roger!” urged
Dick.</p>

<p>Roger would not have stirred an inch, only he
saw that his cousin was already clambering as
fast as he could go. Impulsive, headstrong and
even careless Roger might be at times, but he
was no coward, and he would not climb to safety,
leaving his chum to face any peril from which he
was freed.</p>

<p>They managed to get fairly well lodged in the
bare branches of the mountain oak before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pursuing animal arrived. The bear stood up on
his hind legs and tried to reach their dangling
moccasin-covered feet, meanwhile snarling savagely,
and manifesting the most determined desire
to avenge his injuries.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said Roger, “we both hit him,
Dick, for you can see he is bleeding from two
wounds. Oh! why did I let my gun fall when I
stumbled that time? If I had it here with me
now I could soon fix that fellow!”</p>

<p>“Then you must leave that to me this time,
Roger,” remarked the other, who had managed
to slip the strap of his gun over his shoulder as
he drew near the tree, so as to have both hands
free for climbing—and he had certainly needed
them, too.</p>

<p>Dick now began to load his gun, meanwhile
watching the actions of the furious bear. The
grizzly was trying to gain lodgment among the
lower limbs of the tree that had offered the fugitives
an asylum; but he did not seem to know
how to go about it, or to utilize those long, sharp
claws that had been given to him by Nature
more as a means of offense than for climbing
purposes.</p>

<p>Several times he fell back heavily, only to give
vent to his ferocity in sullen roars. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Dick, having sent the patched bullet home with
his ramrod, began to prime the pan of his long
gun, so as to be ready to make use of the weapon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE TERROR OF THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Make</span> sure work of him, Dick!” Roger said,
in trembling tones, as he saw the other draw
back the flint-capped hammer of his gun, showing
that it was ready for business.</p>

<p>The grizzly was still displaying all the signs
of furious anger, and there seemed some danger
that he might manage to gain lodgment among
the lower limbs of the tree.</p>

<p>“No hurry, Roger! And, another thing, I’ve
concluded that, since you brought this trouble
on our heads by that unlucky shot, you should
be the one to finish our enemy, not me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick, do you really mean it?” cried
Roger, filled with delight. “I’ve been saying
over and over again that some day I hoped to be
able to kill one of these monsters that the Indians
fear so much. Do you intend to lend me
your gun, and let me finish him?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll promise to keep cool, and watch for
your chance to make the bullet tell. We haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
so many of them along with us that we can afford
to waste even a single one.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">

<div class="caption">“HIS TREMBLING FINGER SUDDENLY PRESSED THE TRIGGER”</div>
</div>

<p>“I give that promise willingly,” said the
other, as he stretched out his hand for the gun.</p>

<p>Having it in his possession, Roger’s first
move was to lower himself a little. He meant
to further excite the beast, and cause him to remain
upright until the gun, being brought to
bear on his head, within a foot or so of the small,
gleaming eyes, could be fired with full effect.</p>

<p>“Careful not to go too far, Roger; he is waiting
to make another try for you!” warned the
watchful Dick.</p>

<p>So the young marksman paused, and, settling
himself firmly in a crotch of the tree, bent forward.
The gun was held at an acute angle, and
the tiny sight near the terminus of the long,
shining barrel could be seen against the dark
fur of the bear.</p>

<p>When the beast opened his mouth to give utterance
to another roar, Roger knew his time
had come. His trembling finger suddenly
pressed the trigger, there was a loud report, a
still louder roar, and then a scuffling sound.</p>

<p>“He’s down!” yelled Roger, in anticipated
triumph.</p>

<p>“Give me the gun, so that I may reload it!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the other boy called, meanwhile observing the
significant actions of the grizzly with mingled
curiosity and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The animal had fallen over, and seemed to be
struggling desperately to get up again on all
fours. But that last leaden missile must have
reached a vital part, for, as the seconds passed,
these efforts became more and more feeble until,
just as Dick primed his weapon again,
there was a last spasmodic movement. Then
the huge animal remained motionless.</p>

<p>Roger sprang down from his perch, in his
usual reckless fashion; but there was no longer
any danger, for the bear was dead. The boy
placed his right foot on the huge bulk, and
waved his hat in triumph; for, after all is said
and done, he was but a lad, and this marked the
highest point in his career as a hunter of big
game.</p>

<p>“They’ll never believe it, Dick,” he exclaimed,
“unless we carry back something to
prove our story. And that means we’ve got to
slice off these claws to show. After this we can
have necklaces made of them, and the Indians
will look on us as mighty hunters.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Roger, and, if you start
with that one, I’ll attend to the other fore paw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
They are enough to give you a cold shiver.
How our mothers would turn pale if they saw
them, and knew what a narrow escape we had.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but our fathers would pat us on the
back, Dick, and say that we were ‘chips of the
old block,’ because they many times took their
lives in their hands the same way, when founding
their homes on the frontier, and know what
it is to face the perils of the hunting trail.”</p>

<p>Dick kept on the alert while engaged in his
task of severing the claws of the dead bear.
After having seen those strange Indians passing,
not so very long ago, he realized that there
was always more or less danger of others being
in the neighborhood. And those three loud reports,
as the guns were fired, would carry a long
distance, telling the natives that white men
were around.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred, however, to give them further
alarm, and presently, the claws having been
obtained, the two boys continued on their way
toward the distant camp.</p>

<p>It was at least two hours later that they
sighted the Mandan village, near which the camp
of the exploring expedition had been pitched.</p>

<p>Knowing that, any day now, winter, while
somewhat delayed, might break upon them, Captains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Lewis and Clark were preparing for a long
stay here, and their hunters were laying in a
supply of fresh venison to be made into pemmican.
(<a id="Note_2r"></a><a href="#Note_2">Note 2</a>.)</p>

<p>When the two boys reached the camp, bearing
the terrible claws of a grizzly, their arrival
caused a great sensation. Roger did not spare
himself in relating the story, for he knew his
own failings; but, since it had come out well, he
received nothing but congratulations.</p>

<p>The old forest ranger, Jasper Williams,
lingered after the others had gone, and Dick
saw that he had some sort of communication to
make. The boys had managed to save Jasper’s
life when they were all prisoners of the warlike
Sioux, and, ever since, the trapper had felt a
great interest in the cousins.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“I’m going off with two companions on a
short trip,” he now told the boys. “We may
be gone a week, or even two, for we wish to investigate
the truth concerning some stories that
have come to us concerning a wonderful valley
among the mountains, where all sorts of strange
animals abound, even to goats that leap off the
loftiest crags, and striking on their curved
horns, rebound safely. It is even possible that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
if we find the stories true, we may spend most
of the winter there trapping and hunting.”</p>

<p>The boys were sorry to learn this, for they
were fond of Jasper and had hoped to see much
of him during the long winter.</p>

<p>“We start in an hour, so as to get to a certain
point by sundown,” the ranger told them further.
“You see, the winter has been holding
back so long now that it is apt to start in any
time with a furious storm, and the sooner we
get to where we are going the better. The
snow falls very deep in the mountains, and there
are avalanches that bury everything under them
forty feet deep.”</p>

<p>It was in the heart of Roger to hint that they
would be delighted to accompany the ranger;
but a look from Dick caused him to bite his
tongue and refrain. Afterwards, when they
had seen the three men start forth, and cheered
them on their way, Dick consented to explain
his reasons for motioning to his cousin to say
nothing about going along.</p>

<p>“We can’t expect to be in everything, you see,
Roger,” he said. “After all, we are only boys,
and some of the men here still look on us as inferior
to them in ability to accomplish things,
because they are so much stouter and stronger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
We can find plenty to occupy our minds and
hands while they are gone. Perhaps, who
knows? should they come back, one of the men
may not want to return with Jasper, and that
would be our chance to try for an invitation.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right, Dick,” grumbled
Roger. “You nearly always hit the nail on the
head. But it would have been a fine trip for us.
And, now that I’ve met with and killed one of
these terrible grizzly bears we’ve heard such
tales about, I’m burning with eagerness to shoot
one of the strange mountain goats Jasper was
telling about, that have such immense, curved
horns.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time for all that, Roger,” the
other told him. “The whole winter is before
us, and when spring comes, as we head further
into the West we will have to cross many mountain
chains before we see the ocean. Among
them we will surely come across numbers of
these queer goats, as well as elk, buffalo and
antelope.”</p>

<p>So Roger finally became reconciled to what
could not be changed. There was really no
occasion for his feeling that way long, because
Dick busied himself in mapping out new ventures
every night, as they sat before the campfire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with hands twined about their knees, and
talked of home, and what wonderful sights they
had looked upon since leaving the settlement of
St. Louis.</p>

<p>Two days thus passed, and the boys were
looking forward to doing further roaming, if
the weather permitted, on the following morning.
The afternoon was drawing to a close,
and in the west the sun sank toward his bed
among the far distant mountain peaks, while
the heavens began to take on a glorious hue.</p>

<p>The camp of the explorers was a bustling
scene at such an hour, for preparations were under
way for the evening meal, the fires burned
cheerily, and it was almost time for the guard
to be changed.</p>

<p>Being under strict military rule, the members
of the expedition day and night pursued their
vocations with the same care as though they
really anticipated an attack from some unseen
enemy. Guards were posted at night, and no
one was allowed to enter or leave the camp without
giving the countersign.</p>

<p>This was done partly because Captain Lewis
and Captain Clark believed in discipline, one of
them having been brought up in the little army
of the new republic. There was also another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
reason for keeping a constant watch. There
had been a number of French half-breeds in this
region before their arrival, and these men, who
had been reaping a rich reward trading with the
various tribes of Indians, viewed the coming
of the Americans with great disfavor, believing
it might bring their harvest to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Rumors had reached the ears of the commanders
of the little force that some of these
men were trying to excite the Sioux to take up
the buried hatchet, and proceed in force against
the Mandans and their new white allies.</p>

<p>On this account, then, it was necessary that
the camp be guarded against a sudden surprise.
At least, if trouble came the explorers did not
mean to be caught napping by the cunning redmen.</p>

<p>“You don’t think it feels much like snow, do
you, Dick?” Roger asked, as they stood looking
around them, with the sun commencing to drop
down behind the horizon.</p>

<p>“The signs do not show it,” the other told
him; “but you know they sometimes tell us
wrong. The season is so late, now, that we’re
liable to get a heavy storm any day and, as it’s
growing colder all the time, it will come as snow
and not rain. Once it falls, the Indians say we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
will not see the bare ground soon again. But
what are the men running to the other side of
the camp for, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“Listen, one of them just shouted that a man
was coming, mounted on a horse,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“That sounds as though it might be a white
man,” added Dick, as they hastened through
the camp toward the other side where they
might see for themselves what all the commotion
meant. “Horses are not common in this
country. We are running short ourselves, since
we’ve had some stolen by prowling Indians, two
died, and the three men who started down the
river took as many more with them.”</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at a point where
they could look toward the southeast, for it was
to that quarter the attention of the members of
the expedition seemed to be directed.</p>

<p>Dick uttered an exclamation that was echoed
by his cousin. Their faces expressed the utmost
dismay and alarm and there was good
reason for this, as the cry that broke from
Roger’s lips indicated.</p>

<p>“Oh! Dick, what can it mean? There is the
messenger who carried away our precious
paper, coming back to camp on a worn-out horse.
Something terrible must have happened!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I’m</span> afraid you are right, Roger,” Dick replied,
as the two pioneer boys hastened to be
among the first to meet the rider when he came
jogging into camp.</p>

<p>That something had, indeed, happened was
easy to see from the dejected manner of the
messenger. His face bore a deeply chagrined
look, as though there was some reason for his
feeling ashamed.</p>

<p>He had evidently pushed his horse hard all
day, for the animal was worn out, and reeking
with sweat, despite the fact that there was a decided
chill in the air.</p>

<p>The man dropped wearily from his hard
saddle. He came very near falling, for, after
sitting in that constrained attitude for many
hours, his lower limbs were benumbed, so that
for a brief time he did not have the full use of
them.</p>

<p>By this time Captain Lewis had heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
clamor, and come out of his tent to ascertain
what had happened.</p>

<p>Possibly he may have supposed that it was
only a visit from some of the Mandans on an
errand connected with their now friendly association
with the whites. Then again, the commander
may have wondered whether one of the
hunting parties had arrived with some unusual
species of game, such as none of the explorers
had ever seen before.</p>

<p>When, after striding forward to join the
crowd, he saw the dusty messenger, a frown
came upon his ordinarily pleasant face. Captain
Lewis knew that something must have gone
amiss, or the man who, with two companions,
had started over the back trail several days before
would not have returned to camp in this
way.</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Mayhew?” he demanded,
as he came up, the others parting to
allow a free passage, though naturally the two
boys stuck to their posts, because they had an
especial interest in whatever story the returned
messenger might be about to relate.</p>

<p>“Something has happened, Captain Lewis,
I’m sorry to tell you, and not at all to my
credit,” replied the man, trying to calm himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
though it was evident that he was laboring
under great stress of emotion.</p>

<p>“Were you attacked on the way?” asked the
President’s private secretary, who had been entrusted
with most of the responsibility of the
excursion, and therefore felt more keenly than
any one else the possibility of failure.</p>

<p>He had taken great pains to keep a daily account
of the trip up to that point, and this diary
he had sent to the head of the Government in
the care of the three men, one of whom now
stood before him with dejected mien.</p>

<p>“We believed we had taken all ordinary precautions,
Captain,” the messenger continued,
making a brave effort to confess his fault as became
a man; “but, in the darkness of the night,
they crept upon us without any one being the
wiser. My horse gave the alarm with a whinny,
and, as I awoke, it was to find that the camp had
been invaded by several enemies.”</p>

<p>“Could you not see whether they were Indians
or otherwise?” asked the commander, as
though a sudden suspicion had flashed through
his brain.</p>

<p>“It was very dark, and our eyes were not of
much use, sir,” the messenger told him in reply.
“We purposely refrained from building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
anything but a small cooking fire, and that was
in a hole so its light might not betray us to any
wandering Indians. But they were not red men
who attacked us; of that I am assured.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so certain of that?” inquired
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“We were all struggling with the intruders,
who had evidently thrown themselves upon us
just as my horse gave the warning whinny,” the
messenger explained. “I am positive that my
hands did not clutch the greased body of a redskin,
when I tried to throw him. Clothes he
certainly wore, such as all frontiersmen do. I
could feel the deerskin tunic, with its fringed
edges. Besides, I tore a handful of his beard
out in my struggles.”</p>

<p>“No more proof is needed!” declared Captain
Lewis. “They must have been some of the
French half-breeds. But go on, Mayhew, have
you other distressing news for us? What of
your two companions; I hope they did not meet
their fate there in the darkness?”</p>

<p>At that the man’s face lighted up a trifle. He
had told the worst, and the rest would come
easier now.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed, sir, none of us were badly
injured, strange as it might appear,” he hurriedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
explained. “Bruised we certainly were,
and greatly puzzled at both the attack and its
sudden ending, that left us still alive; but we
were at least thankful it had been no worse!”</p>

<p>“And then what did you do?” continued the
leader of the expedition.</p>

<p>“We stood guard with our guns ready the remainder
of the night, sir, but we were not again
disturbed. It was toward morning that I made
a sudden discovery, which is what has brought
me back to the camp to report, while my two
companions kept on with your documents intended
for the President.”</p>

<p>Captain Lewis drew a deep sigh of relief.
That was the first intimation he had received
that his precious communications had been
saved.</p>

<p>“Then explain why you have returned, if the
papers were saved!” he demanded, as though
puzzled.</p>

<p>“You forget, sir, that I was entrusted with another
paper, which you ordered me to personally
hand to the grandfather of the two boys
who joined us.”</p>

<p>When Mayhew said this, Dick and Roger
knew that a new trouble had descended upon
their heads. He must have lost the paper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
some manner and yet neither of the lads was
able to understand how it could have happened.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say the paper they set such
store on is missing?” Captain Lewis demanded.</p>

<p>“I had it securely hidden in a pocket inside
my tunic, Captain,” replied the humbled messenger;
“but, when I came to look for it, it
could not be found. When morning came we
spent a full hour scouring the vicinity, but it
was useless. And there had not been a breath
of wind to carry a paper away. It must have
been taken from me while I was struggling with
that unknown man.”</p>

<p>“This is indeed a strange story you bring
back with you, Mayhew,” continued the leader
of the expedition, looking keenly at the other,
who met his inquiring glance as bravely as he
could. “Stop and consider, did you hear anything
said that might give the slightest clue concerning
the identity of the thieves?”</p>

<p>“But one word, sir, and that was a name,”
came the ready answer. “The man with whom
I was grappling, as we rolled over and over on
the ground, suddenly let out a loud cry. I
plainly heard him say the one word ‘Alexis!’
And then he suddenly threw me aside, for he
was very powerful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“And did the fighting cease immediately?”
asked Captain Lewis, quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the others seemed to take that word
as a signal, for the next thing I knew my companions
were calling out to ascertain whether
I had been seriously hurt. I found that
they also had been bruised, and one had a
knife wound in the arm, but not of a serious nature.”</p>

<p>The captain turned toward Dick and Roger.</p>

<p>“You have heard what Mayhew says, my
boys,” he remarked. “Does it afford you any
sort of clue as to the meaning of this mysterious
attack in the dark, and the seizure of the paper
you were sending home?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it does, Captain,” Dick replied.</p>

<p>“You recognize the name, then, do you?”</p>

<p>“It is that of the grown son of François Lascelles,”
replied Dick; “the rascally French
trader who has bought up the claim against our
parents’ holdings down near the settlement of
St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“Then it is possible that they followed you
all the way up here, and, having obtained the assistance
of some equally desperate border characters,
laid a cunning plot whereby they meant
to win by foul means, where fair could not succeed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
What puzzles me most of all is how they
could know that Mayhew carried the paper. I
should dislike very much to believe we had a
traitor in our little camp!”</p>

<p>The captain looked around at the assembled
men with a serious expression on his face, which
caused some uneasiness among the soldiers,
frontiersmen and voyageurs who made up the
expedition. They had always shown themselves
loyal to their commanders and, when the
finger of suspicion pointed their way, all felt
the disgrace keenly.</p>

<p>Mayhew it was who came to their relief.</p>

<p>“I could never believe, sir, that any one here
could be so treacherous,” he hastened to say, as
though anxious to take the entire burden of responsibility
on his own broad shoulders, in
which he proved himself to be at least a man.
“I have been seriously thinking it over as I
rode all day long, and believe I can see how it
may have been known that I carried the boys’
packet.”</p>

<p>“Then explain it, Mayhew; for I must confess
that the whole thing is a great puzzle to
me,” Captain Lewis told him.</p>

<p>“When they saw us depart they knew, of
course, that you would be sending a report of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the progress of the expedition to the Government
at Washington, sir. They must have also
surmised that the boys would have influenced
Jasper Williams to sign the paper that would
free their homes, and that one of us must be
carrying it to St. Louis. Do you not think that
is reasonable, Captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but tell me how they could have picked
<i>you</i> out as the one bearing it?” asked the other,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“The only explanation I can give is that they
must have been in hiding near us at the time
we camped,” continued Mayhew. “I remember
taking the packet out, so as to fasten it in
my pocket anew, since it was not as secure as I
desired. I believe some one was watching from
the bushes near by, and saw me do it. Then,
while we struggled there on the ground, he managed
to tear open my tunic, and, while half-choking
me, snatched the paper away.”</p>

<p>“And giving a prearranged signal at the same
time to tell of his success,” remarked the captain,
this time nodding his head in the affirmative,
as though he had come around to the same
way of thinking as Mayhew.</p>

<p>“The fighting ceased as if by magic,” declared
the messenger. “One minute all of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
were struggling as for our lives; then that cry
rang out, and immediately we found ourselves
deserted. We heard retreating footsteps, a
harsh laugh, and shortly afterwards the distant
hoofstrokes of horses being ridden rapidly
away.”</p>

<p>“And you slept no more, but stood on guard,
not knowing but that the unseen and mysterious
foes might return to finish their work?” suggested
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“It was well on toward morning at the time,
sir, for we had slept. I think they took a lesson
from the redskins, who always make it a point
to attack a camp just before the coming of
dawn. They believe that men sleep heavier then
than earlier in the night.”</p>

<p>“You talked it over with the other men after
the paper was missed, did you,” continued the
commander, “and decided that, while they continued
on their long journey, it was your duty to
return and report your loss?”</p>

<p>“I was broken-hearted over it, sir; but it was
my duty. If I have been neglectful, I must
stand the consequences. But we saw nothing
suspicious, and did not dream of danger until
it burst so suddenly upon us.”</p>

<p>“I shall say nothing about that until I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
consulted with Captain Clark, who, you know, is
the military leader of the expedition. Have
your horse rubbed down, and secure food and
refreshment for yourself, Mayhew. I must talk
with these boys now.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>READY FOR A FRESH START</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Turning</span> to Dick and Roger, Captain Lewis
told them to follow him to the shack where he
and Captain Clark transacted whatever business
they found necessary for the conduct of the
expedition. It had been built so that the severe
cold of winter might not interfere with their
comfort and such was the success of the experiment
that other cabins were even then in process
of construction for the remaining members of
the party.</p>

<p>Here they found the military head, busy with
his charts. The leaders knew so little of the
mysterious country which they were bent on exploring
in the coming spring that notes were
carefully kept of every scrap of information obtainable.</p>

<p>Often this consisted of fragmentary tales related
by some wandering Indian concerning the
strange things he had encountered far away toward
the land of the setting sun. Allowances
were made for the superstition of the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
when a record was kept of these tales; but often
there seemed a shred of truth behind it all which
could be made to serve the purposes of the daring
explorers.</p>

<p>So deeply interested was Captain Clark in
some work on which he was engaged, and which
seemed to be in the nature of making a new map
of the country through which they had already
passed, that he had actually paid no attention
to all the shouting outside.</p>

<p>When his colleague came in, accompanied by
the two boys, Captain Clark realized for the first
time that something out of the ordinary must
have happened.</p>

<p>He listened intently as the story of Mayhew’s
strange loss was unfolded, asked a number of
questions that put him in possession of all the
known facts, and then gave his conclusion.</p>

<p>“I am of the same opinion as the rest of you!”
he declared. “It must have been the work of
the men who would profit should that paper fail
to reach the Armstrongs by spring; this French
trader, François Lascelles, and his equally unscrupulous
son, Alexis.”</p>

<p>“But to think of them following us all the
way to this point! It seems almost impossible,”
urged the other captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why should it be considered so?” asked the
soldier, who appeared to grasp the salient points
much easier than the President’s private secretary
had done. “We have encountered no difficulties
that a party of hardy voyageurs and
trappers might not have overcome. Besides, it
is quite possible that this same trader may have
been in this country before now. The French
were in possession of the great Mississippi
Valley all the way down to the Gulf many years
before it came into the hands of the United
States Government. They must have had trading
posts far to the west, and their half-breed
trappers have taken beaver and all other fur-bearing
animals from the streams of the Far
Northwest.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Captain Clark,” said the
other, warmly “and, after hearing your reasonable
explanation, I can well believe that these
men are no strangers to the region of the headwaters
of the Missouri.”</p>

<p>“I also agree with Mayhew regarding the
camp having been watched,” continued the soldier,
gravely. “They suspected we would be
sending back a report of our progress, and surmised
also that these brave boys would either
themselves carry their paper to their homes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
else give it into the keeping of our messengers.
Just how they knew that Mayhew was carrying
their document, and not either of the other messengers,
I cannot say, but it seems that they
managed to do so.”</p>

<p>He turned to Dick and his cousin to say:</p>

<p>“I am sorry indeed that this new trouble has
befallen you, my lads, but throughout your long
journey you have shown such fortitude, and
such determination to succeed, that I feel sure
you will not be downhearted now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” replied Dick, for Roger
could not say a word, since a lump in his throat
seemed to be choking him. “We have been
brought up by fathers who never knew what it
was to despair. I was just wondering whether
François Lascelles would immediately destroy
that document, and then go on his way, resting
under the belief that he had ruined all our work
of months. He may have forgotten one thing,
which is that Jasper Williams still lives, and can
duplicate his signature, with both of you for witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was about to say,” declared the
soldier, with a smile of satisfaction, “and it
pleases me to know that you have hit upon the
same idea. Yes, while this Lascelles may think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he has won his fight, the battle is never over until
the last trump has sounded. When you
again secure the signature you require, we will
see to it that another messenger is dispatched
to your home bearing it.”</p>

<p>Roger managed to find his voice then.</p>

<p>“But how are we going to reach Jasper Williams,”
he asked, anxiously, “when he has gone
off to find that wonderful valley where the game
is so plentiful, but which the Indians are afraid
to visit on account of the spirits that guard it?”</p>

<p>The two captains exchanged glances. They
realized that difficulties indeed lay in the way of
accomplishing the plan they had so cheerfully
laid out.</p>

<p>“He may come back in a week or two, he told
me,” Dick explained, “and then again it is possible,
if his companions agree, and the place
suits them, that they may not return until late in
the winter.”</p>

<p>“And it would be too late then to get the paper
to our people at home,” sighed Roger, looking
exceedingly downcast.</p>

<p>“I think I voice your sentiments as well as my
own, Captain Clark,” said the private secretary
to the President, “when I make this suggestion.
We can place one of our trusty hunters in charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of these lads, and send them off to try to find
Jasper Williams and his party, whose general
direction we already know.”</p>

<p>“I am of the same opinion, Captain,” added
the soldier, promptly, showing that he must have
been thinking along similar lines. “Indeed, if
an immediate start were made, they might even
overtake the others on the way, for I do not
fancy they will be in any great hurry, since they
have orders to make notes of all they see by the
way.”</p>

<p>At hearing this Roger brightened up considerably.
As usual, a way out began to appear
when things had become almost as gloomy as
seemed possible. As for Dick, he eagerly seized
upon the chance to be doing something. Like
most pioneer boys, these Armstrong lads had
been brought up to strive to the utmost when
there was anything worth while to be attained.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Captain Clark, and you, too,
Captain Lewis!” he hastened to say, “that is the
kindest thing you could do for us. We will get
ready to start in the morning and, if our old luck
only holds out, we shall expect to come up with
Jasper Williams inside of a few days.”</p>

<p>“You will need a good trailer to assist you,”
remarked the soldier, “and among all our men I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
do not know of any who is the equal of Mayhew
if only you would not have any ill feeling toward
him on account of what his carelessness
has already cost you.”</p>

<p>“Why, it was hardly his fault, that I can see,
sir,” declared Dick, “and I have always liked
Benjamin Mayhew very much. If he cares to go
with us, tell him we will be only too glad of his
company.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Captain Lewis, who knew his
men as few commanders might, “and this I am
sure of—Mayhew will strive with might and
main to retrieve himself. You will find that he
has really taken his bad luck to heart. He will
want to prove to us that he is capable. He will
do wonders for you, lads, and I believe you show
the part of wisdom in wishing him to accompany
you.”</p>

<p>“Then consider that settled,” said the soldier.
“I will have Mayhew in here presently, and talk
with him. You can make your preparations for
an early start in the morning.”</p>

<p>“And both of us trust success will crown your
gallant efforts to serve your loved ones at
home,” said Captain Lewis. “I well remember
your fine old grandfather, David Armstrong.
His name is familiar to all who know the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the early settlements along the Ohio, where
such valiant pioneers as Daniel Boone, Simon
Kenton and Colonel Harrod led the way into the
wilderness, and lighted the torch of civilization.”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant for the boys to know they
had such strong friends in the leaders of the expedition
making a track across the newly acquired
possession of the young republic.</p>

<p>When they left the shack they somehow
seemed to feel anything but downhearted. Indeed,
with the buoyancy of youth they now faced
the future hopefully, almost certain that they
would quickly find Jasper Williams again, and
bring him back to the camp, where he would
make out and sign a new document, to be witnessed
by both the captains, whose names were
sure to carry weight in any court of law.</p>

<p>“It might be a great deal worse,” admitted
Roger, as he accompanied his cousin to their
quarters in order to make what simple preparations
they thought necessary for the early morning
start.</p>

<p>“Many times so,” Dick assured him. “Why,
after all, this may turn out to be one of those
blessings in disguise our mothers have so often
told us about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will have to explain that to me, Dick,”
admitted the other boy, “for I own up that
it is too much for my poor brain to understand.”</p>

<p>“Listen, then,” continued the other. “What
if that scheming François Lascelles had delayed
his attack on the messengers for days
and even weeks, until they were almost at St.
Louis, and then secured our paper? We would
never have known about its loss, and could not
send another!”</p>

<p>“That is so,” assented Roger, nodding his
head as he managed to grasp the point his companion
was making.</p>

<p>“Then again,” continued Dick, who could follow
up an argument with the skill of a born
lawyer, “suppose the three messengers had
been killed in that night attack, we should not
have known a thing about it. Our paper, as
well as the valuable reports sent to the President,
would have been lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and, Dick, we would have gone on enjoying
ourselves all through the winter, never
knowing that we had failed to save our homes.”</p>

<p>“As it is,” continued the other, “Lascelles,
believing he has cut our claws, may take himself
out of this section of country, so that another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
messenger would have nothing to fear from
him or his band.”</p>

<p>“You are making me ready to believe that,
after all, this may have been the best thing
that could have happened,” laughed Roger, as
he began to examine his bullet-pouch to ascertain
just how many leaden missiles it contained,
and then pay the same attention to his
powder-horn. For it was of the utmost consequence
that in starting forth on this quest,
that might consume not only days but weeks,
they should be amply prepared for any difficulties
that might arise to confront them.</p>

<p>That was destined to be a busy evening for
the two lads. They molded bullets, replenished
their stock of powder from the stores
of the expedition, talked over matters with
Mayhew, who seemed greatly pleased at the confidence
they expressed in him, and even managed
to lay out something of a chart for their
guidance.</p>

<p>This map was made up of suggestions from
Captain Clark, who had talked with Jasper Williams
before the latter and his two companions
left camp, and knew in a general way what direction
they expected to take.</p>

<p>Before Dick and Roger allowed themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
think of sleep, they had everything arranged
for the start in the morning. It was a great
undertaking for two boys to think of venturing
upon, but certainly not any more so than when
they left their homes near St. Louis, and headed
into the trackless West with the intention of
overtaking the Lewis and Clark exploring expedition.</p>

<p>And both of them had faith to believe the
same kind power that had watched over their
destinies thus far would still continue to lead
them by the hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>ON THE TRAIL TO THE BAD LANDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the first peep of dawn both lads were
astir. Their hearts and thoughts were so
wrapped up in the desire to once more find
Jasper Williams and obtain his signature to
a duplicate document, that, to tell the truth,
neither had slept at all soundly.</p>

<p>As all preparations had been completed, there
was little for them to do except get their breakfast,
shoulder their packs, say good-by to the
two leaders of the expedition, as well as the
men, and start boldly forth.</p>

<p>Before the sun was half an hour above the
horizon the little party of three had left the
camp and the nearby Mandan village behind
them, and were on their way.</p>

<p>It was known just where Williams and his
companions expected to spend their first night,
having started at noon, so none of them felt
any necessity for trying to follow the trail until
that point had been reached.</p>

<p>All through the morning they moved on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as noon approached drew near the place where
the camp had been mapped out.</p>

<p>“That much is settled, Dick, you see!” ventured
Roger, as he pointed to where the dead
ashes of a fire were visible, there having been
no high wind to blow them broadcast.</p>

<p>“Yes, they spent the first night here,” admitted
the other, “and so they must have just
two and a half days the jump of us.”</p>

<p>“That’s a long start,” grumbled Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, we expect to keep on the move each
day longer than they will,” explained the other.
“Then again, they may find some place so much
to their liking they would conclude to spend a
couple of days there hunting or trapping. Jasper
is always one to say a ‘bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush’; and those stories about
the wonderful valley that is haunted by the
spirits may turn out to be fairy tales after
all.”</p>

<p>“And now the real work begins, when we
have to follow this trail,” added Roger, who
acted as though he did not want to lose a single
minute.</p>

<p>“That is not going to be such a hard problem,
I should think,” Dick told him. “In the
first place, they will not try to hide their trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
very much, because they do not expect hostile
Indians to follow them; though at night, of
course, they will take every precaution against
a surprise. And then again, Roger, we know
something about trailing, while Mayhew, here,
has not his equal in our camp, so Captain Clark
told me.”</p>

<p>Mayhew did not hear this, for he was busy
looking around the camp, examining the cold
ashes, and in various ways picking up little
details that an ordinary person would never
have been able to discover.</p>

<p>“Unless—well, I might as well own up,
Dick,” said Roger. “I’ve been wondering
whether after all that tricky Lascelles would be
satisfied to go away from here after destroying
our paper. He might know about Jasper Williams’s
trip to the Wonderland the Indians
tell about, and try to capture him, so as to
keep him from signing another paper for us.”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head as though he did not believe
such a thing could be possible.</p>

<p>“It <i>might</i> happen that way, Roger, but I feel
pretty sure we’re well rid of that rascal. Let
us keep the one thing before us to find Jasper,
and fetch him back to camp again in time to
start afresh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, Benjamin is beckoning to us, Dick;
he is ready to start off,” and Roger eagerly
obeyed the finger of the guide, for he was anxious
to be on the move.</p>

<p>They did not even stop to make a fire and
cook anything at noon, but munched some food
that had been brought along with them. Roger
begrudged even a ten-minute stop, when it was
not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“We ought to keep on the move as long as
daylight lasts,” he declared. “After it gets
dark there’ll be plenty of time to rest, and do a
little cooking. By then we might possibly be
lucky enough to reach their second camping
place.”</p>

<p>Time passed on, and constantly the little
party pressed ahead. Just as had been hoped,
Williams and his companions did not seem to
care to hide their trail; though, when the chance
offered, they always took a course that gave
them an opportunity to walk on hard ground,
or even rocks, which actions sprang from the
natural caution of frontiersmen.</p>

<p>Slowly the sun sank toward the golden West.
The boys surveyed a low-lying bank of somber
gray clouds and wondered if the long delayed
opening snow-storm of winter might spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from that source. Roger as usual found cause
for new anxiety in that possibility.</p>

<p>“If it does come down on us, you see, Dick,”
he said, complainingly, “the first thing we’d
lose the trail we’re following, and then we’d be
in a nice pickle. What could we do if that happened?”</p>

<p>“Just as we did when following the explorers
along the Missouri,” he was told. “Use our
heads to figure things out and take chances.
It has worked with us lots of times, and will
again.”</p>

<p>“You mean we’ve got a general idea where
that valley they are heading for lies, and might
get there even without following their trail; is
that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and to reach it we will have to pass
through the country the Indians fear so much,
so that, before we are through with this trip,
we may know whether there is any truth in
those strange tales or not.”</p>

<p>“They tell of a large and beautiful lake in
which the river with the yellow stones along
its bank has its source,” Roger went on, recalling
all he had heard. “Then there are marvelous
fountains that have spirit breath, the
red men say, and spring up from holes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ground, to try to reach the skies. They tell
of many colored stones, and mud as blue as
the heavens; they say it is the home of the
Evil Spirit, and that no one’s life is safe who
wanders that way, and passes a single night
there.”</p>

<p>“But you do not believe such silly stories, I
hope?”</p>

<p>“Whether they are true or not, I am not prepared
to say,” replied the other, after a little
pause; “but you ought to know me too well to
think so ill of me as to believe that a hundred
evil spirits would keep me from exploring that
country of the big lake and the flowing fountains,
and all the other strange things!”</p>

<p>So they talked as they moved along. Much
of the labor of following the trail fell upon
the shoulders of the frontiersman, Mayhew,
who seemed only too glad to assume the responsibility.
Not once did he lose the track.
When it crossed a stony section he seemed to
be able to decide just the point for which the
others must have been making, and in all cases
he quickly pointed out the tracks again where
the soil became soft enough to allow of impressions.</p>

<p>They had seen considerable game while on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the way, though not stopping to obtain any
fresh meat. All that could keep until they had
overtaken those who were ahead. So, although
Roger was greatly tempted when he discovered
a trio of big elk feeding in a glade not a quarter
of a mile to windward, he shut his teeth hard
and told himself that on another day his chance
would come.</p>

<p>Here were jack-rabbits in plenty, gophers
whistled in the little open stretches, antelopes
were seen feeding on the prairies that lay between
the uplifts, while ducks and wild geese
swam on the waters of small ponds, and might
easily have been bagged had the boys cared to
take the time.</p>

<p>Some of the rapid little streams they crossed
looked as though they might be well stocked
with splendid trout; indeed, they often saw
fine gamy fellows dart out of sight beneath some
overhanging bank. They loved to fish as well
as any boys who ever lived; but just then felt
it necessary to put the temptation behind them.</p>

<p>Once they even discovered a herd of buffalo
not a great distance away.</p>

<p>“How I would like to creep up on them, and
pick out a nice young bull to drop,” said Roger.
Then he shook his head and heaved a sigh, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
there came before his mental vision the happy
home so far away, over which such a dark
shadow rested, and which could only be dissipated
through the efforts of himself and his
cousin.</p>

<p>“One thing we ought to remember with
thankfulness,” remarked Dick, “and that is
that so far we have seen not a single sign of
Indians. The Mandans do not come this way
very often, you know, and the Sioux are even
more timid about venturing into the region of
the Bad Lands; but there are other tribes who
are not so fearful.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Blackfeet and the Crows,”
Roger added; “both of them fierce fighters,
and hating the whites like poison. I’m afraid
we will see more or less of them before we get
back to camp.”</p>

<p>“We have always been able to take care of
ourselves in the past, remember, Roger, and
can again. Here are three of us, well armed
and determined. If the Indians try to do us
injury they will find two can play at that game.
Our fathers had to fight just the same kind of
enemies away back there on the Ohio, and if
we’re ‘chips of the old block,’ as they tell us,
why shouldn’t we do as well? There, Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
has discovered something, and wants to
show us.”</p>

<p>Mayhew showed the boys where Jasper and
his two companions had dropped down behind
some bushes, and crawled along for quite a distance.</p>

<p>“Here is where they stopped to raise their
heads,” explained the guide. “I think they
must have discovered some enemies over in that
direction, for they always kept peering out that
way. See, here is where they even plucked
some of the dead leaves from this bush to glue
their eyes to the opening. It is an old hunter’s
trick for a moving branch might betray the one
in hiding.”</p>

<p>A short time afterwards Mayhew seemed
pleased, for he announced another radical
change in the trail he was following so carefully.</p>

<p>“The danger was passed successfully, you
can see,” he told the boys, “for here they arose
to their feet again, and hurried on, perhaps
bending low, because they were careful to keep
behind these rocks. After this we may not find
it so easy to follow the trail, for they have
scented danger.”</p>

<p>It turned out just as he said, and from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
time on it required the exercise of considerable
woodcraft on the part of the frontiersman to
enable him to detect the tracks of the three
whom they were pursuing.</p>

<p>Now Jasper and his two friends had followed
an outcropping stone ledge as far as they could,
and swung across a patch of soft ground by
means of a dangling wild grave-vine. Another
time they had stepped upon an overturned tree,
proceeded some distance along the trunk, and
then made a great leap for some spot where
soft-soled moccasins would leave but scant evidence
of their passing.</p>

<p>But Mayhew was acquainted with all these
methods of concealing a trail. He had spent
much of his life in the wilderness, and knew
Indian ways as well as any man Dick and Roger
had ever met.</p>

<p>Gradually that long afternoon gave place to
the coming of night. Shadows began to steal
out from among the trees and stalk boldly.
More and more difficult did it become for the
trailer to see the faint tracks of those he was
pursuing. Finally he came to a full stop.</p>

<p>“It is no use trying further, lads,” Mayhew
told them, “for there would be constant danger
of losing the trail entirely. Unless we choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to risk lighting torches, and keeping on, we
must make camp here, cook something to eat,
and then get what rest we may, looking to a new
day and an early start.”</p>

<p>Although Roger hated to give up, he knew
there was nothing else to be done.</p>

</div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE STRANGE AWAKENING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was little that the two lads did not
know about making a camp, for they had been
accustomed to spending nights in the woods
ever since they first learned to handle a gun,
and bring down the game so necessary for daily
food.</p>

<p>The spot chosen by their guide for passing
the night was as suitable as could be found at
that late hour. Around them lay the woods,
the trees tall and not of any generous girth,
for the slopes of the hills bordering the Yellowstone
are covered with a growth of pine that
is not noted for its size.</p>

<p>When Mayhew tossed his pack aside the boys
followed suit. They had made a long day of
it, and were tired, though ready enough to keep
moving could it be to their advantage.</p>

<p>The woodranger started to make his little
cooking fire, while Dick and Roger arranged
their blankets and made other preparations for
the night. If they noticed the actions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
guide at all it was with slight interest, for both
were fully acquainted with the methods which
he used in his work.</p>

<p>Like many other things copied from the Indians,
this idea of a small blaze that could not
betray their presence had become a part of
every woodsman’s education. The way in
which it was done was very simple.</p>

<p>First a hole was scooped out of a place where
there was something of a depression, and in this
a small quantity of inflammable tinder was
placed. Flint and steel, upon being brought
violently together, produced the necessary
spark, and the handful of fine wood took fire.</p>

<p>It was carefully guarded on all sides so that
not a ray might escape to attract attention;
and, when sufficient red coals had accumulated,
what cooking was necessary could be carried
on over them.</p>

<p>When properly done, this sort of fire might
remain undetected twenty paces away by the
possessor of the keenest vision. Only the presence
of suspicious odors, such as of burning
wood, or food cooking, might betray the fact
that there was a fire in the vicinity.</p>

<p>All Mayhew wanted was to heat some water,
and make a pot of tea, of which he was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fond, although it was a great luxury of that
early day. The supper itself would have to be
eaten just as it was. They had a fair amount of
bread, such as was baked by the camp cook;
plenty of pemmican, and that was about all.
If the food supply ran short they must depend
wholly on what game they could bring down
with their rifles.</p>

<p>Most boys of to-day would view such a limited
bill of fare with alarm, and think starvation
was staring them in the face. These lads
of the frontier, however, were accustomed to
privations. They faced empty larders every
time stormy weather prevented hunting. And
early in life they learned that it does no good
to borrow trouble.</p>

<p>The night closed in around them. Dick and
his cousin lay in their blankets and conversed
in whispers, while Mayhew continued to busy
himself over his tiny fire.</p>

<p>Around them lay the wilderness that was almost
unknown to the foot of white man, yet it
did not seem to awe these adventurous souls,
simply because they had been brought up in
the school of experience, and were familiar with
nearly all the ordinary features of a vast solitude.</p>

<div class="caption">“MEAGER THOUGH THAT SUPPER MAY HAVE BEEN, THERE WAS NOT A WORD OF COMPLAINT”</div>
</div>

<p>When the guide had his pannikin of tea ready
he told the boys to fall to, and, being sharp
pressed by hunger, they did not wait for a second
invitation. Meager though that supper
may have been, there was not a word of complaint,
even from Roger. The pemmican
tasted good to him, the dry bread was just what
he craved, and the bitter decoction which
Mayhew had brewed seemed almost like nectar.</p>

<p>Having accomplished its mission, the tiny fire
was allowed to die out. Mayhew managed to
light his pipe, which appeared to afford him
much solace, and all three lay there, taking
things as comfortably as possible, while they
discussed in low tones the prospects ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Each one offered an opinion with regard to
what sort of weather they might expect in the
near future. In doing this they consulted the
stars, together with the prevailing winds, and
whether this last seemed to carry any moisture
in its breath since that would indicate approaching
rain or snow.</p>

<p>It was the general belief that the prospect
could be set down as uncertain. It might
storm, or another fair day might speed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
on their way; matters had not as yet developed
far enough to settle this question.</p>

<p>The silence that had accompanied the coming
of the night no longer held sway.</p>

<p>From time to time various sounds drifted to
their ears to announce that the pine forest bordering
the banks of the mysterious Yellowstone
River were the haunts of many wild animals
that left their dens, after the setting of the
sun, for the purpose of roaming the wilderness
in search of prey.</p>

<p>Far in the distance they could occasionally
hear, when the wind favored, the mad yelping
of a pack of gray mountain wolves, undoubtedly
on the track of a stag which they meant
to have for their midnight supper, if pertinacity
and savage pursuit could accomplish it.</p>

<p>Closer at hand there came other sounds.
Once the boys stopped speaking, and bent their
heads to catch a repetition of a peculiar cry
that would have sent a cold chill through any
one unaccustomed to woods life.</p>

<p>“That sounded like a painter to me, Dick!”
ventured Roger, handling his gun, so as to make
sure the weapon was within reach of his
hand.</p>

<p>Of course a “painter” meant a panther, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was so called by nearly all back-woodsmen and
pioneers of that day. And these two lads knew
well what a fierce antagonist one of those great
gray cats became when wounded, or ferociously
hungry.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was just what I thought,” replied
Dick; “but there isn’t much chance he’ll
bother to pay us a visit to-night. The woods
are big enough to give him all the hunting he
wants, without trying to invade our camp.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be plenty of life in this valley
of the Yellowstone River,” the second boy
continued, “and, even if Jasper Williams fails
to find the Happy Hunting Grounds he is looking
for, he might do lots worse than stay around
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure there must be lots of fur to
be picked up, and we saw plenty of elk, you
remember, Roger, as well as other food animals.
From what we have learned, the Indians
never come in this direction unless they are
compelled to by a scarcity of game in other
places.”</p>

<p>“All on account of their believing an Evil
Spirit haunts the land,” commented Roger.
“As for myself, I think all those stories must
be made up in the brains of foolish people. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
would never believe one of them unless I saw
the things with my own eyes.”</p>

<p>“We may know more about them before we
finish this journey,” Dick remarked complacently.</p>

<p>“When you last examined the tracks left by
Jasper Williams and his party, Benjamin, how
old did you make them out to be?” inquired
Roger of the guide.</p>

<p>“We are one day’s journey behind them,”
came the assured reply.</p>

<p>“And if they should choose to linger on the
trail we may overtake them by to-morrow
night,” added Dick, in order to comfort his
cousin.</p>

<p>“Then all I can say,” continued Roger, “is
that I hope they’ll run short of fresh meat, and
conclude to loiter on the road. If Jasper only
discovers a big colony of beaver in a stream,
I think he would be tempted to camp near by
and start trapping.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mayhew remarked, reflectively, between
puffs, “he is always talking about beaver
pelts, and I have heard him say many times
that he never could resist taking the broadtails
if given a fair opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have seen signs of the houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the little animals several times as we came upon
streams that flowed into the river,” said Roger,
“so there may be a chance of our coming upon
him before another sun goes down.”</p>

<p>The thought appeared to give him satisfaction,
and from that time on Dick noticed a difference
in Roger’s manner. Only one thing
kept cropping up to make him sigh occasionally,
and this was the possibility of snow catching
them, and in a short time obliterating the
trail of the party ahead.</p>

<p>The last thing Roger did, before wrapping
himself in his blanket, was to step over to where
he could look up at the heavens. The stars
were shining peacefully. They did not look unusually
bright, which would have been a bad
outlook, according to the woodsman’s reckoning
of the weather signs. The bank of low-hanging
clouds must have remained close along the
horizon, or else passed away by some other
route, for he now saw no trace of them.</p>

<p>“I really believe it will be all right, Dick,”
was his cheerful announcement as he settled
down for a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>Dick did not reply; but, knowing how capricious
the weather could prove, he had already
made up his mind to be surprised at nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Even if he awoke in the morning to find three
inches of snow covering the ground, coming so
silently they had not known of its fall, he was
prepared to take it philosophically. Perhaps,
like a wise general, he had already mapped out
in his mind just what course they must pursue
under such conditions, for Dick Armstrong had
always been prone to foresee difficulties, and
prepare to meet them as they came.</p>

<p>Roger soon fell asleep. Even his thoughts
of the faraway home were of a pleasant nature,
and not calculated to keep him awake.
Besides, that long day’s tramp over so much
rough ground had wearied his muscles, and a
languor came upon him shortly after he
wrapped his blanket about him.</p>

<p>A root served as a pillow. These hardy sons
of the frontier needed no down under their
heads as they slept. Privations they had been
accustomed to from infancy, and a small amount
of comfort usually satisfied them. Doubtless
their slumber was all the more sound on that
account.</p>

<p>Roger had no means of telling whether one
hour or five had crept by, when he was aroused
by something that gave him a fierce tug. Instantly
he was awake, and, although at first he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
imagined he must have been dreaming, he
changed his mind when he heard a low, snarling
sound close to his ears, and felt another of
those queer tugs.</p>

<p>It was cold, for, in rolling about as he slept,
he must have displaced his blanket.</p>

<p>That jerk at his right leg gave Roger a thrill.
He realized that something had taken hold of
his fringed deerskin trousers, and was endeavoring
to drag him aside. Even as this startling
conviction flashed through his mind, for a third
time he heard that low growl. It was like that
of a dog, when some one approaches while he
is gnawing a bone.</p>

<p>Roger slightly raised his head and saw two
gleaming yellow spots that seemed to glow like
coals of fire.</p>

<p>He knew they were the eyes of some sort of
forest beast that was crouching close alongside
him; though why it had seized upon his
trouser leg and kept up this spasmodic tugging
Roger could not comprehend.</p>

<p>Where was his rifle? He put out a hand,
groping for the weapon, which action was the
signal for more growls, and a spitting sound
such as a cat might make. Then he heard a low
whispering voice saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep still, Roger; don’t move! I’ve got
my gun, and can fix him! Steady, now!”</p>

<p>Then came a mighty crash that awoke the
echoes of the forest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE VALLEY OF ENCHANTMENT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Roger</span> knew what was expected of him under
such conditions. A regard for his own safety
induced him to roll aside. If the wounded animal
endeavored to fasten upon his body in its
death throes, he preferred to be in some other
and safer locality.</p>

<p>There was confusion for a minute or so.
Roger, after escaping from the claws of the
unseen beast, scrambled first to his knees and
then to his feet. He could not think of going
back to search for his gun, because something
was struggling on the very spot, and he could
imagine what that writhing object must be.</p>

<p>So he drew his hunting knife and waited.
Then the sounds began to grow fainter, which
the boy knew was a promising sign. Finally
all became still again.</p>

<p>“Dick!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here, Roger,” he heard his cousin
say.</p>

<p>“Is he dead, do you think?” asked the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have just poked about with the barrel
of my gun, and touched him,” Dick replied.
“There’s no movement to the body, so I feel
sure I finished him. Come this way; I felt your
gun with my foot just now.”</p>

<p>They had no means of seeing the motionless
form of Dick’s quarry, unless they chose to go
to great trouble with flint and steel and tinder.
There was really no need of this, because all
of them were familiar with the denizens of the
forest; so that, using their hands, they readily
ascertained the nature of the invader of the
camp.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only a wildcat, after all, Dick!”
exclaimed Roger, a note of disappointment in
his tones, as he came upon the abbreviated
tail. “I was so sure it was the painter we
heard crying earlier in the night.”</p>

<p>“I thought the same way, Roger,” confessed
the other, “until I came to feel the fur, when
something told me it was different. But we
never yet killed such a wildcat as this, in all our
tramping.”</p>

<p>“It does seem to be a monster,” admitted the
other.</p>

<p>“It is not only the size I meant, Roger, but
feel of the ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, how very strange, Dick; for all the
world like a tassel at the end! What kind
of a beast have we run across? We never
saw wildcats like this along the Missouri, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I have heard old voyageurs tell about a
species they meet with further north in the cold
country of the Chippewas and the Crees.
They call it a lynx in Canada. It is a very
fierce beast, all accounts agree.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, think of his coming right into
our camp, and trying to carry me off! I never
would have believed it if any one had told the
story. He tugged at my leg again and again.
It was that woke me up, I expect. If that’s
the kind of wildcats they have in this country,
I am not surprised at the Indians keeping away
from this region.”</p>

<p>“There must be some reason for the beast
acting as it did. I think we will find that in
rolling about you must have managed to get
over the spot where Benjamin laid our stock
of pemmican, and that was what the beast was
after.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do you think so?” remarked Roger,
heaving a sigh of relief. “Well, I shall be glad
to believe he was not trying to carry me off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
But all the same, Dick, you never before heard
of a wildcat being so bold.”</p>

<p>“I never did, and that is a fact,” admitted
Dick.</p>

<p>They settled down once more, though this
time Roger changed his position so as to make
sure he would not invite a repetition of the attack.
Mayhew, too, had taken warning from
the adventure; he proceeded to fasten their
stock of dried venison to the limb of a tree in
such a way that it would be safe from the depredations
of any hungry animal.</p>

<p>That one alarm was not repeated. Throughout
the balance of the night prowling wild
beasts might roam the forest and seek their
prey, but they gave the camp of the little party
a wide berth. Perhaps they scented trouble in
the blood of their kind that had already been
spilled.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn the boys were up
and doing. Roger examined the stiffened form
of the lynx with much curiosity. He seemed
to be of the opinion that, since the ice had now
been broken, they were apt to run across many
other strange creatures, the like of which they
had never before set eyes on.</p>

<p>Indeed, before they had been an hour on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
way that morning, they began to notice that
a remarkable change was taking place in the
character of their surroundings. The sun’s
rays, falling on the face of a hill, filled them
with awe, for it seemed to reveal almost every
hue of the rainbow. Here a waterfall burst
upon their vision, the stream dropping fully a
hundred feet, and looking like a bridal wreath
as the light breeze carried the fine spray to leeward,
through several rainbows.</p>

<p>“The Enchanted Land, of a truth, Dick!”
was Roger’s comment, as they came to a full
stop, to gaze upon these remarkable sights.</p>

<p>“Already it begins to look to me as though
there might be some truth in the weird stories
the Indians have been telling about this country
up here,” the other boy confessed.</p>

<p>As for Mayhew, the guide, he could not find
words to describe the mingled feelings of admiration
and wonder that filled his soul. None
of them dreamed of turning back, although they
were beginning to encounter sights such as the
eyes of white men had possibly never before beheld.</p>

<p>“Jasper was not dismayed by all this,” said
Dick, “for we can see that he and his party
kept on, following the course of this river of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the cataracts and the rapids. So we, too, must
march on.”</p>

<p>“I feel thirsty,” remarked Roger, shortly
after this, “and as here runs a nice looking
little stream I think I will take a drink.”</p>

<p>Dick was about to follow suit when he saw
Roger suddenly start up from his kneeling position,
with a look of the most intense astonishment
on his face.</p>

<p>“Why, Dick, it burns me!” he cried. “The
water is hot!”</p>

<p>Dick immediately tested it with his hand.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Roger, it seems as though
it might be over a fire. Do you know, I noticed
something like a trace of steam, but I thought
it only such vapor as we often see rising from
ice-cold water.”</p>

<p>“But who ever before met with boiling water
in the open?” asked Roger. “Why, there must
be fires under the earth here, such as leap out
of volcanoes in other countries.”</p>

<p>He even rested his hand on the rock close by,
but found it cold. Vegetation grew all around
the hot stream and pool, showing that it never
overflowed its banks at any time.</p>

<p>“There’s one good thing about it,” remarked
Dick, turning to the frontiersman; “after this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
if these hot springs are common here, you will
never need to build a fire in order to make a
pannikin of tea.”</p>

<p>“I can believe almost anything after this,”
muttered Roger, as he dabbled his hand in the
pool, and quickly snatched it out again, for the
water seemed to almost scald his flesh. “Of
course nothing can live in such a stream. I
wonder what next we will run across. Cats
with tassels on their ears, rocks and mud looking
like they had been painted every color going,
waterfalls that drop from the clouds, and
where rainbows play hide and seek in the sunlight,
and now a boiling spring, and a hot pool.
What if one of us had fallen in here, and could
not get out?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon begin to believe in those stories
the red men tell of the Evil Spirits that live in
this enchanted valley,” laughed Dick, who
seemed determined not to allow himself to be
dismayed by anything wonderful they might encounter
in their wanderings.</p>

<p>“I’m getting that way even now, Dick. I
tell you, it wouldn’t surprise me very much if
we ran upon one of those monsters they say
used to live in America centuries and centuries
ago, much larger than an elephant. I only hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
my rifle speaks true, if ever I have to face anything
like that!”</p>

<p>Leaving the hot spring behind them, they
pushed on along the trail made by Jasper Williams’s
party. Doubtless those three men were
also filled with wonder at what they saw.
Roger more than once expressed doubt as to
whether they would have the courage to continue
their explorations much further, surrounded
as they found themselves by such marvelous
freaks of nature.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me if we met them
hurrying back out of here,” he told his companions.
“Jasper himself is a bold spirit, but
I have a poor opinion of the two other men
with him. I believe they are inclined to be
superstitious, like the Indians, and these things
are enough to make the flesh creep.”</p>

<p>Here and there, as openings occurred, they
could catch glimpses of distant peaks that
looked like cathedral spires in the gilding rays
of the sun. Dick was drinking in these pictures
with eagerness, for the boy had something of
the artist in his nature. He could appreciate
such glorious works wrought by the deft hand
of nature more fully than Roger, who saw
rather the practical side of the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, during that morning tramp, Roger did
receive a fright. It did not come from any
threatened attack on the part of a ferocious
wild beast, nor yet through his narrow escape
from falling into some pit where strange, gurgling,
mysterious sounds oozed forth. On the
contrary it was just because it started to snow
furiously, so that the whole landscape was
blotted out.</p>

<p>“That settles it, Dick,” he exclaimed, in
sheer disgust, “we’re done for now. The only
thing left us is to head as best we may for the
place we believe the Valley of Wonders lies, and
which we must be close to, right now.”</p>

<p>“You are in too big a hurry, Roger,” his
cousin told him. “Just because a few flakes
chance to come down is no proof that we are
in for a storm. Look up and you will see the
blue sky over yonder. It is only a passing
squall, and soon over with, so cheer up.”</p>

<p>His prophecy proved true, because in another
minute the snow ceased to fall, and out came
the welcome sun again, to once more paint the
hillsides with his wondrous brush, and stripe
them with rainbow tints.</p>

<p>“You must own up that most of our troubles
come and go like that,” commented Dick. “At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
first they seem to be dark and heavy, but all
at once the sun breaks out, and we forget the
gloomy past. It ought to be a lesson to you.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Dick, but my nature is different
from yours. I am either bubbling over with
joy or else weighed down with foreboding. But
we can see some distance ahead at this point,
and I must confess that there is no sign of a
human being, so Jasper and his comrades cannot
be returning along the trail.”</p>

<p>“The wind is shifting for one thing,” observed
Dick, “which may bring about a change
in the weather before very long.”</p>

<p>“Listen, what do you suppose that sound can
be? If the weather were not so cold, and the
season summer instead of early winter, I would
surely say it was distant thunder!”</p>

<p>All three stood still to listen intently. Presently
the far-away rumbling sound was again
borne to their ears; and, just as Roger had declared,
it was like distant thunder coming from
beyond the range of forest-clad hills.</p>

<p>It was not strange that the two boys and the
frontiersman turned uneasy looks upon each
other, surrounded as they were by such strange
freaks of nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>SURROUNDED BY MYSTERIES</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> about the swivel gun in the camp;
could it be heard as far away as this, do you
think, Dick?” asked Roger, as though a new
idea had flashed into his mind.</p>

<p>The other shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he replied, “and, even if it were
possible, you forget that it is only when the
wind picks up from this new quarter that we
hear the sound.”</p>

<p>“And that is from the northwest, while our
camp lies back yonder, more in the northeast,”
admitted Roger. “I admit that, when I spoke,
I was picturing a horde of half-naked Indians
trying to carry the camp by storm, and Captain
Clark rallying his defenders behind the
breastworks we built out of pine logs and
earth.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing of that sort, I am sure,” said
Dick, “though, when you ask me to explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
origin of that sound, I am as much in the dark
as you.”</p>

<p>“Well, as our way lies toward the northwest,”
remarked Roger, “there’s some satisfaction
in knowing we will be getting closer to
the mystery all the time.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you are not afraid,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“There can be no telling what state I may
be in before we get out of this strange country,”
admitted Roger, laughingly. But Dick
knew him too well to think he could show any
sign of fear.</p>

<p>Mayhew said little, for he was naturally a
man of few words. He could not be reckoned
as above the average of his class; and possibly
there was a well-defined streak of superstition
in his nature, even as it was to be found in other
bordermen of the day.</p>

<p>Left to his own devices, perhaps Mayhew
would have much preferred not to advance any
further into this unknown and terrifying land.
He had no particular desire to learn whether
the stories told were true or false; and the
camp that had been left behind held many alluring
claims to his regard.</p>

<p>But his honor as a reliable borderman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the balance. He could not forget that, chiefly
through his carelessness, there had been lost
a paper entrusted to his charge, which was of
the utmost value to these lads.</p>

<p>Hence he was firmly resolved to stand by
them, no matter what happened, for the object
of their venture was to duplicate the document
he had allowed to slip out of his hands.</p>

<p>“There is the river over yonder; I can see
the sun shining on the tumbling water of one
of the numerous cataracts,” Dick commented,
as he pointed in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“The Indians have a story to the effect that
it springs from a great fresh water inland sea
lying over the ridges somewhere,” Roger remarked,
as he stood looking at the foaming surface
of the stream. “Do you believe there is
any truth in that account, Dick; or can it be set
down as a fable, like this Evil Spirit of the
land?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it seems that others have looked upon
the great lake at a distance, French traders and
voyageurs, and they say it is surely there,” the
other affirmed. “Who knows but that, before
we see our good friend Captain Lewis again,
we, too, may be able to boast of having set eyes
on the mirror lake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Lewis told me he would give much
for the privilege of accompanying us; but duty
would not permit,” Roger observed.</p>

<p>“Yes, he cannot forget that the President
committed the fate of this exploration into his
hands, and looks to him to supply all the information
possible,” said Dick. “So Captain
Lewis, like an honorable and conscientious gentleman,
will not take any unnecessary risk in
order to gratify his curiosity. His place is
there in the camp.”</p>

<p>Feeling hungry as noon arrived they munched
some of the hard pemmican while keeping on
the move. That suited the impetuous Roger,
for it was virtually “killing two birds with one
stone”; they satisfied their hunger, and yet
found no reason to delay their progress in order
to do so.</p>

<p>Mayhew still found a way to discern the trail
of those who had gone over this same ground
ahead of them. Indeed, it would have to be
a faint track that his practiced eyes failed to
discover.</p>

<p>All this while there had been a perceptible
change in the character of the country. It kept
getting more rocky, and wilder the further they
advanced. Roger was constantly looking on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sides as though expecting to discover some new
and remarkable thing at any minute. Indeed,
Dick was also considerably worked up over the
strange conditions surrounding them, and made
up his mind not to be surprised at anything that
might happen.</p>

<p>It was when they were in this receptive frame
of mind that something occurred out of the
common, to alarm them. Roger was the first
to hear a sound, though Dick, seeing him come
to a sudden halt, and stand in an attitude of
listening, also began to catch it.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Benjamin,” said Dick, in a low
tone, “there’s something queer going on around
us that we must look into before proceeding
further.”</p>

<p>“Of all the strange things, did you ever hear
such a terrible groaning before, Dick?” asked
Roger. “I wonder if it has anything to do
with the noise we caught before, that was so
like thunder.”</p>

<p>“Hardly, for that was surely far away, while
this is close by,” replied the other boy, with a
puzzled look on his sun-browned face.</p>

<p>Roger even took off his foxskin cap, as
though he imagined that the dangling flaps
which he used to keep his ears warm in bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
weather might interfere with his sense of hearing.</p>

<p>Again those strange groanings made themselves
heard. This time both boys managed to
locate the sound as coming from the right.
That was at least one point gained, and it was
toward that quarter they now turned their attention.</p>

<p>If they had been trying to pick out the most
difficult spot in all the wild vicinity, they would
have selected that toward which their attention
was now directed. The rocks seemed to
be piled on one another in hap-hazard fashion.
Here and there they formed deep chasms, the
sides of which were so precipitous as to be incapable
of being scaled by any creature short
of a monkey.</p>

<p>“It comes welling up out of the ground itself,
Dick,” ventured Roger, presently, with awe in
his manner, as though, after all, he might be
wondering whether there could be any truth
in the tales told of the Evil Spirit that haunted
these weird ridges, speaking in thunder tones
at one minute, and with dreadful groanings the
next.</p>

<p>Dick believed in taking the bull by the horns
in a case like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must look into it, Roger; it would never
do for us to say we had been driven away
through hearing some mysterious sound that
we did not understand.”</p>

<p>“There it comes again, Dick, and louder than
before. What can it be?”</p>

<p>“The hot spring seemed to tell of some sort
of fires away under the surface of the ground,”
the other said, reflectively, “and it might be
that this is more of the hot vapor pressing up
through holes in the rocks.”</p>

<p>“But how like human groans the sounds
are!” marveled Roger.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” his companion returned,
“but have you forgotten the time we heard
those terrifying noises coming from the old
mill that stood a mile away from our homes,
and how some of our companions fled, but we
had the hardihood to go inside and look
around?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interjected Roger, quickly, “and we
found the wind forced a way through a crack
between two logs, and made the doleful noise!
It may be something like that here.”</p>

<p>“We will soon know, because I mean to make
my way over there and take a good look
around,” announced Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you go I will keep you company!” declared
Roger, just as stoutly, as he gave a
glance down, in order to make sure that the
powder in the pan of his flint-lock rifle had not
been disturbed, and that the weapon was ready
for instant use.</p>

<p>Together they advanced, with Mayhew keeping
them company. All were constantly on the
alert for signs of treachery and danger. Those
who dealt with the tricky red sons of the forest
in the pioneer days learned to be always on the
watch.</p>

<p>Now the sounds ceased, and the boys exchanged
looks, as if asking each other whether
this could have anything to do with their arrival.
Were hostile eyes watching them from
some rocky covert; and would a signal be given
to launch an attack?</p>

<p>Dick, examining what lay just beyond, came
to a conclusion.</p>

<p>“There is a gaping hole yonder, you see,
Roger?” he noted.</p>

<p>“Where the rocks seem to drop straight
down, you mean?” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is out of that hole the sounds
came. Let us stand here, and wait to see if we
can hear them again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>They had not long to wait. Even as they
stood listening intently, there came once more
a long-drawn moan, which was followed by
others. Then succeeded a rattling sound as
though some heavy body were endeavoring to
creep up the slanting rock, only to slip back
again. They even heard the thud that seemed
to announce the end of the vain attempt.</p>

<p>Still it was all unintelligible to both Dick and
Roger. While the groans continued to well up
out of the basin, they again started to creep forward.
The brink was within plain sight, and in
another minute they would be in position to
peer over the edge.</p>

<p>What new and terrifying wonder they might
discover there they could not even guess, yet it
was with a thrill that the lads kept on, covering
the intervening rock foot by foot.</p>

<p>They reached the brink together, and both immediately
thrust out their heads to take the first
look. Only for a brief space of time did they
stare downward, and then, just as a cautious tortoise
might draw back his head within his shell,
Dick and his companion retreated.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Roger, as he turned his face,
filled with perplexity, toward the other, “did
you see what it was, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“After all, nothing so strange as we thought,”
replied the other. “Instead of a supernatural
happening, it was real human groans we heard.
There are men trapped in that hole, and they
have tried again and again to climb up, always
to slip back again. They must he battered, and
nearly starved, which would be enough to make
them groan, I think.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, I saw one of them plainly, and I
knew him, too!” urged Roger, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Then you saw more than I did,” the other
told him. “From the fact that they are dressed
in buckskin I knew they must be hunters or trappers,
but supposed it would turn out that they
were French voyageurs, such as have roamed
throughout the Northwest country since the
time of Pontiac. Who was the man you saw,
Roger?”</p>

<p>“It was surely Thomas Hardy, one of the men
who accompanied Jasper Williams,” said
Roger, showing much concern. “And I believe
the other to be Mordaunt, the second frontiersman
and trapper. But there is no third in
the party. What can have become of Williams?
If he is dead there is an end to all our hopes.
Oh, Dick, I am afraid!”</p>

<p>Dick’s face had also lost much of its customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
color, for a spasm of alarm had attacked his
bold heart when his companion thus voiced his
fears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ATTACKED BY HOSTILE BLACKFEET</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Cheer</span> up, Roger!” said Dick, making an effort
to look as though he himself had no fear of
disaster. “I’ve often heard my father say it
is foolish to cross a bridge before you reach it.
The first thing for us to do is to let these poor
fellows in the trap know we are here.”</p>

<p>When there was a prospect for action Roger
could rouse himself wonderfully.</p>

<p>“And we must get them out of that deep hole
by hook or by crook, Dick!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The two pushed forward until they could look
down toward the place where they had discovered
the forlorn figures of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hardy—Mordaunt!” called Dick,
just loud enough to make his voice carry to the
men. He did not know what danger might be
near, and on this account believed it the part of
wisdom to be careful.</p>

<p>Immediately the pair below looked up.
When they discovered the boys they manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the greatest delight, even to shaking hands with
each other. Evidently they had been close to
the point of despair.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get you out of that hole
first of all!” called Dick, “and then you can
tell us what happened.”</p>

<p>“Where is Jasper Williams?” demanded
Roger, unable to restrain his impatience longer.</p>

<p>“We do not know,” came the discouraging
answer.</p>

<p>“Then he isn’t down there with you?” pursued
Roger.</p>

<p>“No. The last we saw of Jasper he was still
alive, although hotly pursued.”</p>

<p>Naturally these last words excited Roger’s
curiosity more than ever. He could easily guess
that the party must have met with a stirring adventure
of some sort, and if Williams had fled it
must have been hostile Indians who pursued
him. But Dick would not hear of any further
delay in starting work.</p>

<p>“Come, Roger, I shall need your assistance,”
he told the other. “Bottle up your curiosity
until we can get those poor fellows up out of the
pit. They seem to be injured more or less, for
Hardy has a bandage around his arm that looks
bloody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger was only too willing to render what aid
he could, though the fact struck him that they
were not likely to find it plain sailing.</p>

<p>“If they couldn’t climb up out of that hole on
account of the smooth face of the rock, how shall
we go down to help them, Dick?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That would be foolish,” was the reply.
“We must plan to draw them up here.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, where is the rope to come from?
We brought nothing of the sort from the camp?”</p>

<p>“Then we must find a substitute. Look back
at some of our experiences, and tell me if we
have not done that more than once when in the
forest?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, a wild grape-vine can often be
made to serve the purpose of a rope, because it
is tough and long and pliable. But where can
we get such a thing now?”</p>

<p>“As it happens, I noticed some vines growing
not far back, and I am leading you to the place
now. Look over yonder at that little swale,
where the trees grow so densely; there are vines
hanging from the branches, for I saw them
swaying in the breeze.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do believe you are right,” admitted
Roger, who possessed splendid eyesight. “I
only hope we find one long enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! as to that,” responded Dick, calmly,
“we could easily splice a pair of them. There’s
nearly always a way to do things if only you
make up your mind to do them.”</p>

<p>They soon arrived at the patch of swampy
ground where the undergrowth grew so densely.
It was an ideal place for wild grape-vines, and
small wonder that they grew to such a length,
some twisting in spirals around the trunks of
the trees, others hanging from limbs that were
fully twenty feet overhead.</p>

<p>Roger gave expression to his satisfaction the
minute he set eyes on this network of vines.</p>

<p>“No trouble getting what we want here, I
should say, Dick. Look at that monster vine;
though this one seems better fitted for our purposes,
because it is like a stout rope, if only it
proves tough enough to hold a weight.”</p>

<p>“No trouble about that, I’m thinking,” said
Dick. “You could hang half a ton on that vine
and it would hold. You are a better climber
than I ever claimed to be, so get up the tree and
cut it loose above.”</p>

<p>Nothing suited Roger better than this. Laying
his gun down, together with his powder-horn,
which might be in the way, he started up
the tree indicated. Arriving at the limb to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which the vine they had selected seemed to be
fastened he first examined it carefully, and then
with his knife soon cut it free.</p>

<p>“Take care while I drop it, Dick!” he called,
and shortly afterwards descended to the ground.</p>

<p>The vine was quickly trimmed so as to free it
from useless growth, and, dragging it after
them, the lads once more went to the brink of the
pit that had proved a trap for the members of
the exploring party.</p>

<p>When this substitute for a rope was lowered
it was found to be quite long enough for their
purpose. One of the men immediately started
to climb, and what before had seemed an insurmountable
task now became easy.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later both had been rescued from
their predicament. They were shivering from
exposure and fright, and the first thing the boys
did was to make a small fire in a depression
amidst the rocks, over which some water was
heated, and a pannikin of tea brewed.</p>

<p>When the men had eaten something, and
washed it down with liberal portions of the hot
tea, Roger could hold back no longer. He
wanted to learn what had happened, and how
they had become separated from Jasper Williams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The men had evidently been through a rough
experience, and seemed to have lost all inclination
to proceed any further into the unknown
country of mysteries. Indeed, from certain
words that they had dropped, it was plain nothing
could induce them to return. They meant
to head directly toward the camp near the Mandan
village.</p>

<p>This being the case, Dick was anxious to learn
all he could before the separation came about,
and so he did not attempt to chide Roger on account
of the other’s impatience when he burst
out with:</p>

<p>“Now please tell us what it was all about, and
who pursued Jasper Williams at the time you
saw him last?”</p>

<p>Hardy seemed to be the best talker, for it was
he who answered.</p>

<p>“The Indians came down on us when we were
not expecting an attack,” he explained, looking
somewhat humiliated, for a frontiersman was
apt to feel a blush of shame when compelled to
admit that for once his vigilance had relaxed.</p>

<p>“Were you in camp at the time?” asked
Roger.</p>

<p>“Yes, close to the river,” Hardy continued.
“We had been seeing some wonderful things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and Jasper seemed to believe there were others
even more amazing beyond. Then, like a bolt
out of the clear sky, they dropped down on us.
Some sprang from the bushes, while others appeared
on the river in canoes made from dugout
logs.”</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, as though the recollection
of that sudden attack would give him a
bad feeling for a long time to come.</p>

<p>“But you must have snatched up your guns
and fought them?” pursued Roger, who could
not picture Jasper Williams doing anything
less, since he had the reputation of being an unusually
valiant borderman.</p>

<p>“That was what we did,” replied Hardy.
“After shooting and wounding some of our enemies
we clubbed our guns and strove to beat
our way clear of the howling pack. In some
fashion Jasper became separated from us. We
managed to burst through the Indians, and fled
for the thickest of the neighboring woods.
Somehow we did not seem to be pursued, and,
wondering at that, I looked over my shoulder,
hearing the yells of the savages growing
fainter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what did you see?” Roger demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jasper had managed to leap into one of their
canoes, and was paddling like mad up the rough
water of the Yellowstone, with the other boats
in hot pursuit. They vanished from our sight
around a bend in the stream, but for a long time
we could hear the sound of distant yells when
the wind turned that way.”</p>

<p>“You do not know certainly, then, that Jasper
was captured or killed?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“We cannot say,” replied Hardy. “All we
thought about then was to get away from that
region, and start back to the camp. We have
seen enough of this wild country to satisfy us.
By accident we managed in the darkness of the
night to fall into that hole, and we have been
held prisoners there ever since, suffering all
the tortures of cold, hunger and despair. When
we heard you call out it seemed to us the finest
sound we had ever listened to.”</p>

<p>The men had finished their meal by now, and
seemed anxious to make a start over the back
trail. Dick did not attempt to influence them
to change their decision, for he knew it would be
futile. As they had both lost their powder-horns
in the fight, and their long-barreled guns
were useless without ammunition, he managed
to spare a small amount of the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stuff, enough to give them several charges
apiece.</p>

<p>“You can shoot game, and live in that way until
you reach camp,” he told them as he watched
both men eagerly load their guns. “But what
of these Indians who attacked your party—they
were not of the Sioux or the Mandan tribes, I
take it?”</p>

<p>“No—Blackfeet, and hard fighters,” the man
replied. “I do not believe they would have allowed
us to escape, only that they seemed most
anxious to get Jasper Williams, for all of them
pursued him, some in boats and the rest on
land.”</p>

<p>This struck Dick as peculiar. Why should
Jasper Williams count any more with the hostile
Blackfeet than the other two explorers? His
hair would make a no better looking scalp than
theirs!</p>

<p>Dick was still pondering over this as he shook
the two men by the hand and expressed the hope
that they would meet with no further troubles
until they gained the camp and gave his message
to Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“Have you arrived at any conclusion,
Hardy,” he observed, “as to why the Indians
should want to capture Jasper Williams so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
badly that they would neglect you two, and even
let you escape?”</p>

<p>“We talked that over, Mordaunt and myself,
while we were in the pit,” came the answer,
“and both of us decided that the men who were
with the Blackfeet must have hated our companion,
and had promised a reward to the redskins
if he was captured. That only would explain
the mystery, we thought.”</p>

<p>“Why, were there white men with the Indians?”
cried Dick, beginning to see a gleam of
light. “Were they English, or frontiersmen,
or French?”</p>

<p>“They must have been French, because we
heard them calling out, and it was in that language.
They seemed wild with anger because
Jasper had not fallen into their hands. In the
boats they kept shouting to the paddlers, and
urging them to greater exertion. Yes, the
Frenchmen must hate our companion, and I fear
he will never live to come back to us again.”</p>

<p>As the two men walked away, heading toward
the northeast, Dick and Roger exchanged significant
looks, for they now knew the worst.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>ON THE BANK OF THE YELLOWSTONE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Bad</span> news for us, Dick,” muttered Roger,
shaking his head despondently.</p>

<p>“I am sorry it had to happen,” the other remarked;
“but while there’s life there’s hope.
Jasper is no novice in woodcraft. Those
Frenchmen and their red allies will find it no
easy task to capture him. And even if they
should we are bound to try to bring about his release.”</p>

<p>“It must have been that François Lascelles
and his rascally son, Alexis, surely,” ventured
Roger.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure of it,” Dick admitted, frowning.</p>

<p>“They were not satisfied with destroying the
paper we had sent home, but came back to keep
us from getting Jasper to sign another. Oh!
they are determined to steal our homes away
from us! They will stop at nothing to take
them!”</p>

<p>“All is not lost yet. Remember that we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
always managed to pull through in times past.
We shall again; something seems to tell me so.”</p>

<p>When Dick said this he looked so determined
and resolute that, as usual, Roger found his own
spirits wonderfully revived.</p>

<p>“I complain a lot, I know,” he remarked, as
though ashamed of his actions, “but all the same
I give up hard. Deep down there’s a never-say-die
feeling in my heart. When you say we will
keep everlastingly at it you express what I
feel.”</p>

<p>Both felt better after that. They knew that
it was useless to pay any further attention to the
faint trail of Jasper Williams and his two companions.
They must trust partly to luck in order
to once more run across the man they so
urgently desired to see.</p>

<p>“One thing we must remember,” said Dick,
as they again set forth on their way.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“We have come to know Jasper fairly well
since joining the exploring company, and helping
him to escape from Running Elk’s Sioux.
We even know some of his signals, and if we
have any reason to believe he is around we can
make use of them to communicate with him.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea,” agreed Roger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“Even if he is a prisoner we could let him know
friends were near by using the secret call. But
we seem to be making for the bank of the river;
tell me what plan you have in mind now.”</p>

<p>“You heard me ask Hardy about the exact
place they were set upon by the Blackfeet?
That is where we must go first of all. Trail we
have none, for the last seen of Jasper he was on
the water, which leaves no track. But, starting
from that point we will follow up the river until
we find something.”</p>

<p>“We could not do better, I am sure,” acknowledged
the other, and Mayhew nodded his head as
though he also concurred in the plan.</p>

<p>“If the Frenchmen are Lascelles and his son,”
continued Dick, as they trudged along, “they
would not care if Jasper were killed, so long as
he could not interfere again in their scheme to
defraud our parents out of their property.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, impulsively, “and,
should our friend be captured, they would influence
the Blackfeet to carry him far away to their
village in the Northwest country, where he
would be made to adopt their ways and become
an Indian warrior. Either that, or else he
would be burned at the stake, after their usual
custom with prisoners of war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are close to the river,” Dick announced.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone is a very turbulent stream,
especially far up toward where it has its source
in the great lake of the same name. It rushes
down over its rocky bed with numerous cataracts,
making navigation impossible to any but
canoes managed by the most experienced paddlers.</p>

<p>The fretting of its current was plainly audible
long before the little party arrived on the bank.
Above and below, it wound in and out, seldom
keeping a direct course for half a mile, such was
the roughness of the country through which it
found a passage.</p>

<p>Without wasting any time in admiring the
wonderful picture that was now spread out before
them, the three scouts turned up-stream,
and continued to advance. They were anxious
to reach the scene of the fight between Jasper
Williams’s little band and the Blackfeet, set
upon them by the unscrupulous French traders.</p>

<p>Having now been made aware of the fact that
hostile Indians were roaming the vicinity, they
exercised more caution than up to this time had
marked their pilgrimage into the unknown land.</p>

<p>An hour—two of them—passed, and thus far
nothing had occurred to disturb their peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mind. All this time they had continued pushing
forward. Occasionally they would make a
little roundabout passage so as to clear an open
glade where the danger of discovery was imminent.
No discordant yells from savage
throats arose to thrill them.</p>

<p>“It seems to be a long way off, Dick,” ventured
Roger, who evidently had not taken into
consideration the fact that at the time of the attack
Williams and his companions were something
like half a day’s journey along.</p>

<p>“We must be getting close to the place now,”
he was assured. “I was just deciding that the
next bend in the river would turn out to be where
they made their camp. Hardy told us, you remember,
that they had hardly settled down there
last evening when they were attacked.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was an hour before sunset,” he said.
“They were feeling tired, and the chance for a
fine camp tempted them to stop long before dark
came on. Hardy tried to describe the place to
us, and I suppose you think you can recognize it
from the way the trees hang out over the
water?”</p>

<p>“That is what I settled in my mind; but we’ll
soon know. Given half an hour and we should
be there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The time dragged with the always impetuous
Roger; but finally they arrived at the bend of
the river indicated. All immediately began to
look for signs to prove that the men had camped
there.</p>

<p>A joyous exclamation from keen-eyed Roger
announced that he had found the dead ashes of a
fire in a little depression among the rocks.
Then the others discovered footprints of moccasined
feet, many of them in the softer places
where the earth was not yet frozen.</p>

<p>“Here are the tracks of Indians, for they all
toe in,” Dick observed, stating a fact that was
well known to every pioneer boy of the day.
“Toeing-in” was invariably the sign of an Indian,
though of course some bordermen had also
taken to that method of walking, which is supposed,
to be the natural way.</p>

<p>“And these others were made by whites,
either our friends or the Frenchmen,” added
Roger, quick to pick out those that differed from
the first type.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the track of Jasper,” Dick
told him, as he continued to move this way and
that, his eyes searching the ground as he neared
the bank of the river.</p>

<p>“But tell me how you would know his trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
from any other? Most moccasins make pretty
much the same kind of a mark, I’ve always believed.”</p>

<p>“Well, Williams’s do not, it happens,” the
other explained. “I thought you must have noticed
it as we came along. He bought the pair
he is wearing from a Mandan squaw. They
have a queer seam across the middle. I never
saw one like it before, and I think that is the
track now.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the ground, and Roger, looking,
gave a cry of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It certainly is as you say, and here must be
where Jasper jumped when he made for the
water, and sprang into one of the dugouts. See,
in many places his footprints are partly covered
by those of the pursuing Blackfeet.”</p>

<p>“And this must be where he found the canoe
into which he jumped,” continued Dick, as he
showed his companion a slight depression in
the sand.</p>

<p>Both stood and looked up the turbulent river.
The water tumbled over the rocks that thrust
their heads above the surface in many places;
it even leaped high in the air and sent out clouds
of spray where a cataract could be seen over toward
the other shore. But whatever secret it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
held it gripped tightly, and neither of the boys
could lift the veil.</p>

<p>“I wish we knew what happened up there, and
if Jasper did get away, or was taken by those
plotting French traders and their red allies,”
mused Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, it will do no good for us to stop here
and wish,” his companion told him. “There is
work to be done, and the sooner we start the
quicker we can reach the end. One thing is sure,
if Jasper is alive, whether free or a prisoner, we
will find him!”</p>

<p>There was no need of lingering any longer,
since they had learned all that could be ascertained.
It fitted in with the story told by the
two men who had been Jasper Williams’s companions.</p>

<p>“It seems to me our next best course would be
to keep along the border of the river,” remarked
Dick. “If those who were in the canoes
came ashore it would likely be on this side of the
stream, because it seems to be a better channel
than on the other side.</p>

<p>“Besides, if we watch out we can see the
marks left by those of the Blackfeet who ran
along the shore expecting to head Jasper off;
though I don’t think they could do that, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in many places they would have to pass around
deep coves that lead many rods inland.”</p>

<p>For some time they followed the river. Now
and then they managed to discover some tracks
of the Indians, but at the end these seemed to be
missing, and it was concluded that the band
must have left the stream to pass further back
in the country.</p>

<p>Unable to find any trace of them, the boys
were placed in the position of not knowing
whether Jasper had been taken or not. The going
became so difficult, and the hope of reward
so slight, that in the end they determined it
would be best to also leave the river, and take to
the higher ground.</p>

<p>Here they could wander about, constantly on
the watch for some sign that would indicate a
temporary camping place of those whom they
sought. If a wisp of trailing smoke caught
their attention it would do much to locate the
resting place of the Indians. They must eat,
and particularly the Frenchmen would desire a
warm meal, so that in this way those who sought
them might be rewarded for their vigilance.</p>

<p>Hope was struggling with despair in Roger’s
heart. Look as he might, he could not see any
silver lining to the dark cloud. Still, the energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and resolution that his companion continued to
show buoyed up his own sinking spirits to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>They had now left the river far behind, and
had entered upon a new phase of their journey.
Several times at stated intervals they had heard
that singular deep throated rumble, and felt the
ground tremble under their feet. Whatever it
could be that caused this strange sound, they
were evidently approaching the scene of its mysterious
operations, and might come upon it at
any time.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when
Mayhew uttered the low hiss which they had settled
on as a warning of danger. At that instant
Roger and Dick also caught glimpses of flitting
figures amidst the forest trees, which they knew
must be Indians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>UNEXPECTED HELP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three dropped to the ground, where they
flattened themselves out so as to be as inconspicuous
as possible. Of course the prospect of
approaching trouble caused the hearts of the
boys to beat doubly fast, but they managed to
control themselves.</p>

<p>“Do you think they saw us?” whispered
Roger, finding his head close to that of his comrade.</p>

<p>“We will soon know,” replied the other, in the
same cautious manner. “They have not given a
single yelp as yet. But Mayhew is beckoning to
us. He wants us to crawl along after him,
where these bushes will shield us.”</p>

<p>They kept as close to the ground as possible
while making progress. Now and then one of
them would carefully raise his head to take an
observation. When this chanced to be Dick, his
cousin invariably whispered an inquiry in his
ear, which the other answered with a movement
of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>They could hardly believe that the keen-eyed
Indians had failed to notice their presence,
though it did seem strange that they should have
refrained from announcing their delight at the
discovery in fierce yelps, as was their custom.</p>

<p>Mayhew undoubtedly had some sort of plan
in mind when he beckoned the others to follow.
He was an experienced scout, and knew as much
about the tricky ways of the red men as any borderer
of his time. It was on this account that
Captain Clark had suggested that he accompany
the boys on this trip, as well as to allow Mayhew
a chance to repair the damage his blunder
had done to their cause.</p>

<p>Three times he abruptly changed his course.
Evidently he had a reason for this, and Dick suspected
that the guide must have discovered the
enemy to be lying in wait for them ahead.</p>

<p>It was thrilling, but tiresome. Roger found
himself wishing heartily that something would
happen to break the silence. It seemed to be
oppressive, to be weighing him down as with a
heavy load. Indeed, to the impulsive lad almost
anything would be preferable to this terrible
stillness.</p>

<p>It was while Roger was allowing himself to
give way to this feeling, and wondering whether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
after all, it might not do better if they sprang to
their feet and ran for it, that something did
occur, and of a nature to surprise him.</p>

<p>Crouching at the foot of a tree, and just about
to slowly get to his knees in order to take an observation,
Roger suddenly felt himself pulled
down. Dick had seized his hunting tunic, and
given it a quick, strong tug.</p>

<p>At the same instant Roger heard an odd,
whistling sound that seemed to come from a
point very close to his ear; this in turn was succeeded
by a little thud, such as one might make
when striking his hunting knife against the bark
of a tree.</p>

<p>As the boy twisted his head around, his wondering
eyes fell upon something that caused him
to draw in a long quavering breath. It was the
feathered shaft of a Blackfoot arrow that had
its flint head buried deep in the yielding wood of
the tree. In order to have reached that spot it
must have passed only a few inches above
Roger’s body.</p>

<p>Then the Indians <i>did</i> know of their presence;
the fact of this shaft having been sent in their
direction told the story. Roger somehow found
himself wondering if those stories he had heard
about the Blackfoot warriors poisoning the tips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of their war arrows could have any foundation
in truth. It was not a pleasant thought when
they found themselves at bay, surrounded by an
unknown number of the savage tribesmen.</p>

<p>But Mayhew was once more creeping on; if he
did not wish to be left behind he must follow in
the wake of the guide.</p>

<p>Dick brought up the rear. It may have been
accident that brought this about, and, then
again, perhaps the boy had some design in taking
his place at the end of the line. He knew the
impulsive ways of his cousin, and that there was
always a chance that Roger might get himself
into trouble through lack of caution.</p>

<p>Possibly the guide had knowledge of some locality
that lay a short distance beyond, where
they could defend themselves better than in the
open. The face of the country was rough, and
in many places rocks cropped out that could be
made to serve those who were surrounded by
perils.</p>

<p>Once again was the whistle of a feathered
shaft heard, though this time it simply cut
through the bushes over their heads, and found
no lodgment in the trunk of a tree.</p>

<p>This was the second narrow escape they had
had. It was not to be expected that such good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fortune would continue. Other arrows were
bound to be fired, and at any minute one better
aimed than the rest might find lodgment in a
human body.</p>

<p>Roger gritted his teeth savagely as he crept
on. How he wished Mayhew would come to a
pause, thus signifying he had done all he could
to further their escape, and was now at the end
of his rope! Then they could rise up, and use
their guns upon the crafty enemy, following with
the pistols they also carried, and which at short
range would count for just as much as the rifles.</p>

<p>Was the ground actually trembling underneath,
or did his own shaky condition deceive
him? Roger could not decide this question off
hand. It seemed to him that, when he placed a
hand on the rocks, it felt a warmth that was unmistakable.
At any other time he would have
wanted to stop to discover why this should be
so; but the conditions by which they were surrounded
just then would hardly permit such a
waste of precious seconds.</p>

<p>In imagination Roger could see the Indians
creeping up, bows and arrows in hand, waiting
until a certain point had been reached, when
they would give a concerted whoop, and rush to
the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered if they had ever heard a gun
fired at close quarters and, if not, whether the
sound would alarm them. It had proved to be
the case in other instances he had heard old trappers
mention, where they were saved through
the fear shown by the savages at hearing the
crash, and seeing the flash, when guns had been
discharged.</p>

<p>Ah! that was a third arrow he heard hurtling
past, and it must have shivered into splinters
against that rock when it struck. Either the
marksmen were sending their missiles at random,
or else they had some design in thus driving
the three crouching whites forward. Was
there some sort of a trap beyond, into which they
might fall? Roger was of half a mind to turn
on Dick, and demand that they change their
method of retreat into one of open defiance.</p>

<p>There was no need of his taking this step, because
circumstances decided for him. Even as
he was hesitating, and more than half inclined
to force the issue, there broke out such ear-piercing
yells as neither of the two boys had ever
heard before.</p>

<p>To Roger’s mind that settled it, once and for
all. Further flight was useless—at least, flight
of the slow and hesitating type they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
trying to carry out. If they chose to try to escape
without a fight, then they must take to their
heels, dodging to the right and the left so as to
avoid the rain of arrows that was sure to follow
them.</p>

<p>To scramble to their feet was the work of an
instant. All held their weapons ready for immediate
use, because they believed they would
have need of them, with the enemy charging
from several points at once.</p>

<p>When Roger looked around he found it hard
to decide where to send the bullet his gun carried.
Here and there he could catch glimpses
of flashing forms as they darted from rock to
rock; but all these movements were executed
with such surprising quickness that, although he
several times started to raise his rifle, before he
could obtain any sort of aim the object of his attention
had vanished.</p>

<p>Perhaps the quivering tip of a colored feather
worn in the hair of an agile brave would be seen
above the crown of the sheltering rock, but it
would be folly to waste ammunition on such a
will-o’-the-wisp target.</p>

<p>The worst of the matter was that all this time
the dodging foes were gradually drawing their
ring closer and closer around the three whites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Every time a flitting copper-colored figure
flashed across a little opening, to disappear
again behind other shelter, it was shortening by
just so much the distance separating the two
hostile parties.</p>

<p>Arrows were beginning to hurtle past their
heads, too, as some of the red men found opportunities
to use their bows. That none of the
palefaces had thus far been struck was more a
matter of good luck than anything else.</p>

<p>Mayhew did not mean to stand there and wait
for the coming of all those skulking warriors.
He knew that there must be a score of them, all
told, and, should it come to a hand-to-hand combat
he and his young companions would have
but a sorry chance to hold their own, much less
be victors in the encounter.</p>

<p>In one direction, alone, could he seem to discover
an opening, where for some reason the Indians
had failed to cover the ground.</p>

<p>“Follow me, lads, and duck as you run!” he
shouted at the top of his voice, at the same time
starting off at a furious pace.</p>

<p>Then began a curious race, with the three
fugitives jumping from side to side as they ran,
hoping in this way to escape being hit by any
arrows that might be sent after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the Indians halted to make use of
their bows, but the main body kept after the
three fugitives. If the worst came, of course
the whites could suddenly whirl about, and do
some execution with their firearms, though Mayhew
knew that it would never do to let the pursuers
approach so close as to be able to hurl
their stone-headed tomahawks, with which they
could split a willow wand, if placed against a
tree, at twenty paces.</p>

<p>Mayhew figured that they would be able to
reach the spot he had picked out for a stand, if
nothing happened to upset his plans. Once
there, if they poured a deadly volley in among
their pursuers, and followed that up with a second
from their small arms, the Indians might become
demoralized.</p>

<p>It might have worked as he hoped, but the
chances were that the Indians would have immediately
dodged, and in this way escaped the full
effect of the bombardment. Then, when the firearms
were empty, they would push their advantage,
and numbers must surely tell.</p>

<p>The yells were still rising discordantly behind
them, when Dick began to notice a decided
change to their intonation. What had before
seemed only an outbreak of savage rage now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
had turned to wonder, and even deadly fear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">

<div class="caption">“BEFORE THEM THEY SAW A MIGHTY COLUMN OF STEAMING WATER”</div>
</div>

<p>There was also something else that caused the
boy to turn his head, in order to cast a backward
look. No sooner had he done this than Dick
came to a full stop, his loud shouts attracting
the attention of his two companions, and causing
them to copy his example.</p>

<p>No longer were the eager Indian braves chasing
madly after their intended quarry; on the
contrary, each and every warrior seemed bent
on running like mad in the opposite direction,
as though pursued by a legion of evil spirits.</p>

<p>To the whites there was no mystery in regard
to the fright of the ignorant and superstitious
Blackfoot braves, for before them they saw a
mighty column of steaming water gushing fully
a hundred feet up into the air, to descend in an
imposing flood. As if an unseen hand had directed
it, the giant geyser had spouted just in
time to come between the hostile Indians and
their intended victims!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>DEEPER INTO THE WONDERLAND</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> it must all be true, Dick!”</p>

<p>These words burst from Roger’s lips as he
stood gazing at the wonderful sight. Of course
he referred to the strange tales which they had
heard from some of the Mandans, and which
also passed current among the frontiersmen connected
with the expedition.</p>

<p>Dick was hardly less staggered than his
cousin, and, as for Mayhew, he had the look of
one who believed himself face to face with the
spirit world.</p>

<p>As they shrank back and watched the amazing
fountain pour its flood toward the sky, and
heard the thunder of the falling water, strange
thoughts flitted through their minds.</p>

<p>“Look, Dick, it’s slackening now!” cried
Roger, presently, though he had to exercise his
vocal cords considerably in order to make himself
heard above the tumult of the gushing geyser.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe it is about to stop!” echoed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the other boy, not without perceptible relief in
his tones.</p>

<p>All at once they realized that the flow of
steaming water had ended as abruptly as it had
begun. The pool was still agitated at the spot
where the base of the pillar of water had been located,
but the terrible geyser had ceased to flow.
(<a id="Note_3r"></a><a href="#Note_3">Note 3</a>.)</p>

<p>By degrees the two boys began to recover
from the stagnation of mind and body into which
they had been thrown.</p>

<p>“Come, the danger seems to be past,—for the
present, at least,” remarked Dick; “let us look
into this thing while we have the chance.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” replied Roger, eagerly.
“After this, when any one speaks of these unbelievable
things, we can tell what we have seen
with our own eyes; and how we were saved from
the Indian attack by that fountain of hot water.”</p>

<p>With considerable uneasiness, however, the
two approached the spot where the base of the
water-spout had been. As for Mayhew, nothing
could tempt him to advance a single step. Indeed,
he shook his head several times in a doubtful
fashion, as though he believed it the height
of folly for the others to take their lives in their
hands in such a reckless way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, there’s a hole in the solid rock, Dick,
and it all came out of that!” Roger exclaimed,
after they had drawn close enough to be able to
see.</p>

<p>“It had to come from some sort of cavity, of
course,” remarked Dick, “and that hole is the
place. I think it must ascend once in so often,
for here is a regular runway where the water
passes off. And to think that this same thing
may have been going on for years!”</p>

<p>They listened to ascertain whether they could
detect any sign of a great disturbance down in
the aperture, but without very much success.
Now that it was all over, the boys began to regain
their courage, which had in fact been
greatly shaken by the gushing of the mighty
geyser.</p>

<p>“The Indians have all fled, which is one comfort,”
observed Roger, presently.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was too much for them,” added his
companion. “They believe these things are
caused by the Evil Spirit that dwells inside the
earth, and that he must have been angry at them
because they tried to capture or kill us.”</p>

<p>“As usual, we have been lucky; when even the
water-spouts stand back of us, what have we to
fear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“But now that all is quiet, the Indians may
pluck up courage enough to return,” Dick suggested.
“We must not take too many chances
by staying here. Another time the water might
not come in time to save us.”</p>

<p>“I would like to stay long enough to watch it
rise again,” Roger objected; “but then you are
right, and it would be folly. There may be
others like this in this Wonderland. If half the
Indians tell is true, we have many more things
to see that will make us open our eyes. I am
ready to believe almost anything after this.”</p>

<p>“Watch Mayhew, Roger, and you will see that
we cannot get away from here any too soon to
suit him.”</p>

<p>“No, he keeps standing first on one foot and
then on the other, while he looks to the right and
left. I really think he has already picked out
which way he will run if it should break loose
again.”</p>

<p>“And neither of us can blame him,” added
Dick, “for you know that most of his life he has
associated only with Indians, and such rough
men of the border as ignorant fur-takers and
half-breeds. He thinks about the same as they
do about all things hard to understand, and that
spirits can come back after death. Our mothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
taught us differently, but we should not condemn
those who do not know any better.”</p>

<p>“He is a brave man, and he means to stand
with us to the end,” said Roger. “Only for that
he would have run away as swiftly as the Indians
did. But, Dick, do you believe this was
the cause of that heavy rumbling we heard some
time back?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say. It may have been, for you
remember that the noise seemed to come and go,
at intervals.”</p>

<p>“And the trembling of the rocks under our
feet, too! That must have been caused by something
like this. The hot spring where we said
we could have cooked an egg, or made our tea,
that may have been the overflow from here, or
another fountain like it.”</p>

<p>“All we know is that those stories told by the
Indians had a foundation in fact. And yet,
most people will believe we have simply imagined
these things when we tell them what we
have seen and heard.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Roger, “I only wish there was
some way to show them. Seeing is believing,
mother always says.”</p>

<p>But unfortunately this all happened early in
the nineteenth century, and the camera, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
those amazing geysers might have been caught
in action, and displayed to people at the other
side of the world, had not even taken form in the
brain of the most advanced inventor.</p>

<p>Slowly the lads walked back to where the
guide awaited their coming. Mayhew looked relieved
when they rejoined him. Apparently he
had been dubious as to whether they would be
allowed to return; he may even have suspected
that the angry gods who sent that gushing fountain
soaring two hundred feet into the air might
stretch out their arms and drag the lads into the
yawning crater, to be served as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Which way to head now was rather a difficult
question to answer. If it were left entirely to
the discretion of Mayhew, Dick feared the guide
might take it into his head to veer around and
start back toward the camp, believing that in so
doing he would be serving the interests of the
boys best by possibly saving their lives.</p>

<p>Consequently Dick meant to keep his hand on
the helm, and do most of the directing. Captain
Clark had instructed the guide to put himself entirely
at the disposal of the boys, so that in
reality it was Dick’s place to do the ordering.</p>

<p>Looking around them, it was hard to tell which
way they had better go. Everything was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
strange that although, of course, they knew the
points of the compass, and in a general way
could understand that they must have come in
from the east, still who could say whether the
beckoning west was their wisest goal, or some
other direction?</p>

<p>“We had better try to keep on, and find that
valley toward which Jasper Williams was
headed,” urged Dick, after they had consulted.
“He is a stubborn man in his way, and, even
though deserted by both his companions, I believe
he would push straight on, so that he might
boast of having reached the place he started
for.”</p>

<p>“And if the Blackfeet have failed to capture
or kill him,” ventured Roger, “we may find him
there—of course granting that we reach that
Happy Valley ourselves.”</p>

<p>That point having been decided, they started.
It was not long, however, before they began to
realize that amidst those remarkable cones and
thickets and rocky defiles it was a most difficult
thing to keep their bearings.</p>

<p>“It seems as though we had come over this
part of the ground before,” admitted Dick, “for
familiar objects turn up on every hand; and yet
how can that be when we have kept going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
straight into the northwest for nearly an hour
now?”</p>

<p>“There is something wrong about it all, I’m
afraid, boys,” declared the guide, with a distrustful
shrug of his broad shoulders. “I’m
thinking we will meet with some queer experiences
before we see another sunrise. As for
myself, I am wondering whether any of us will
get through it alive.”</p>

<p>It was not the hostile Indians that caused
Mayhew to say this, nor yet the fact that all
sorts of wild beasts doubtless roamed these wild
places by night. He was accustomed to taking
his chances with such ordinary perils, and
scorned them as a true-hearted borderer must.
But, deep down in his honest heart, Mayhew
feared the supernatural. What he could not
understand stood for something dreadful, that
sent the cold chill of apprehension up and down
his backbone.</p>

<p>“Listen, there is the spouting water at it
again!” exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>True enough, they could catch a deep-throated
rumbling sound that seemed to make the very
atmosphere vibrate. But Dick immediately
made a discovery which he voiced in excited
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that be so,” he told them, “what miracle
is this; for we surely hear that sound ahead of
us, and all this while we have been in the belief
that the great water-spout lay back yonder toward
the east!”</p>

<p>That afforded Mayhew another opportunity
to look worried.</p>

<p>“It’s black magic, that’s what I believe. The
east has become the west! We have all been
turned around, and right now I cannot say which
way I am looking, although I can see the sun
hanging up there above that glittering peak.”</p>

<p>“Dick, what can it mean?” demanded Roger,
uneasily.</p>

<p>“I can think of but one explanation!” declared
the other, steadily. “That is not the
same spouting water we heard just now! You
remember that we decided there might be others
of the same kind in this country of wonders.”</p>

<p>It almost seemed as though nature took delight
in proving the accuracy of Dick Armstrong’s
surmise; for, hardly had he said this,
than they heard once again the remarkable throb
of rushing waters pouring forth from a fissure
in the crust of the earth and, what was more, it
came from some point toward the rear!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger smiled faintly, while even Mayhew condescended
to let some of the worried look pass
away from his face.</p>

<p>“I should not like to roam about this terrible
country after nightfall,” said Roger, shuddering;
“for there is too much danger of stepping
into some bottomless pit, or having a deluge of
boiling water thrown over your head. It’s a
question up here in the winter-time whether you
are going to be frozen to death in a bitter storm,
or roasted by the fires that are under the earth.
I think we must be getting pretty close to where
the Evil One lives, Dick. His workshop may be
around these hills, for all we know.”</p>

<p>Dick, however, shook his head. He was proof
against all belief in the supernatural. Such
wonders as had been encountered on the trip he
felt sure were after all but the products of an
eccentric nature. Though they might strike one
as bewildering at first, familiarity would dull
this feeling of amazement, though it could never
breed contempt.</p>

<p>“We have a short time still before the sun
sinks,” remarked Dick; “shall we go on further
or spend the night here?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather find a better place if it’s the same
to you,” Roger started to say, when to his astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Dick suddenly clutched him by the
arm, and started to drag him away.</p>

<p>At the same moment Roger became aware of
a peculiar and alarming sound, as though loose
rocks and shale were slipping down an abrupt
slope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE LANDSLIDE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Roger</span> tripped over some obstacle, so that both
he and Dick fell flat on their faces, though
neither had the misfortune to be injured other
than to receive minor bruises.</p>

<p>“Why, what happened then?” gasped Roger,
as he sat up and commenced to rub one of his elbows.</p>

<p>Mayhew had evidently also leaped hurriedly
back, for he was crouching near the two boys,
staring fixedly at some point just beyond, and
looking not only puzzled but deeply concerned.</p>

<p>“There was some sort of slip in the rock at
the edge of that hole,” explained Dick, breathing
hard after his sudden exertion. “I was
afraid the whole platform might be about to fall
into the abyss, and that was why I dragged you
back. It was better to be on the safe side, you
know.”</p>

<p>“What will cross our path next, I wonder?”
grumbled Roger. “We seem to be jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
from the frying pan into the fire. First it is
Indians who are about to wipe us out; then we
come near being boiled in a pyramid of steaming
water, and, as if that were not enough, here
we have a narrow escape from being dropped
into a bottomless pit.”</p>

<p>“It’s nip and tuck which sort of end will get
us sooner or later,” remarked Mayhew soberly;
almost as though he had made up his mind that
there was no use of resisting his manifest destiny.</p>

<p>“Let’s get away from this horrible place as
soon as we can, Dick,” urged Roger. “As to
spending the night here, you will have to excuse
me! We had better shoulder our packs and—oh!
where are they, Dick? I am sure I laid
mine down at the time we stopped to take a look
around.”</p>

<p>Dick looked deeply worried.</p>

<p>“Yes, the three of us did the same thing. As
you say, they have disappeared, and I fear we
have lost our blankets and provisions and extra
ammunition.”</p>

<p>His words created a panic in the breast of his
comrade, for Roger scrambled to his feet from
his knees, clutching the sleeve of Dick’s deerskin
hunting tunic, and crying out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! can it be possible that they were carried
down with that avalanche when the slip
occurred? And do you think we can recover
them again?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied the other lad, soberly,
“for it will be a serious thing for us if we lose
all we had in those packs. But we must be careful
how we approach the edge, if it crumbles so
easily. We would not care to be carried after
our blankets, riding an avalanche!”</p>

<p>Cautiously picking their way, they finally
managed to creep to where they could look down
into the yawning abyss. It filled them with awe
and despair. So far as they could see the walls
were almost perpendicular, and extended far beyond
their limited range of vision.</p>

<p>“We could never get down there alive,”
Roger confessed, as he looked shudderingly into
the chasm that had swallowed up their valued
possessions. “And I am afraid we have seen
the last of those blankets.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the other, consolingly,
“once we return to the camp we can obtain
warm furs from the Indians, that will take their
place for sleeping purposes.”</p>

<p>“But what are we to do now,” reasoned
Roger, “far away from the Mandan village, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
so situated that we dare not build a camp fire at
night, no matter how bitter cold it turns?”</p>

<p>“That is a hard question for me to answer,”
Dick admitted, candidly. “If it comes to the
worst, of course we can turn back, and give over
our hunt for Jasper Williams. If he should
change his mind and return to the camp all
would be well. On the other hand, if he stayed
out the main part of the winter, or the Indians
were holding him a prisoner, we would stand to
lose all we had won.”</p>

<p>“And our dear parents must see their homes
taken away from them by that rascally Lascelles,”
groaned Roger, grinding his teeth in his
distress. “Dick, sooner than allow that, I
would try to stay out here all winter, taking my
chances with the wolves, the Indians, and these
terrible things that surround us on every side.”</p>

<p>“Remember our old motto, Roger, that carried
us through so many troubles in the past—never
despair, no matter how black the skies
look. We will come out on top yet,—we <i>must</i>!”</p>

<p>“Do you think that awful hole can have any
bottom, Dick?”</p>

<p>For answer the other dropped a large bit of
rock, being careful to cast it far out from the
wall underneath them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed a long time before they believed
they caught the faintest kind of sound away
down in the black depths.</p>

<p>“Why, it must be nearly half a mile deep!”
cried the astonished Roger. “We can never
hope to see our things again, for a fact.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s the truth,” admitted Dick.
“It is a great misfortune, but we must face it
bravely. ‘There are more ways than one to
skin a cat,’ you know Jasper used to say; and,
while things look dark for us just now, we can
find a way out, never fear.”</p>

<p>They backed away carefully, not wishing to
start another slide that might carry them down
to keep company with the lost outfit. At least
they had their guns, and a fair stock of ammunition
to fall back on. Besides this they were
warmly dressed, and able to resist to some extent
the attack of the wintry winds.</p>

<p>Dick brought this to the attention of his companions
as they trudged onward. He was always
finding some reason for plucking up hope;
conditions, according to Dick’s healthy mind,
were never so had but that they might be worse.</p>

<p>Some time later they drew up, Mayhew suggesting
that they could hardly find a better
place to spend the night than where they were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
A small stream ran past, and it was cold water,
too, as they soon discovered.</p>

<p>“Trout in it!” Mayhew announced, as though
he had something on his mind, “and if you say
the word, I think I can get a few of them. The
season is late; but, since winter is still holding
off, they may bite at a bait.”</p>

<p>“It would be a good idea,” returned Dick,
“since we have lost all our supplies we will have
to get food by all sorts of means. Our guns
should bring us in game, if only we dare fire
them. Yes, try the fishing, Mayhew, and good
luck to you.”</p>

<p>The guide had some hooks with him, for he
always went prepared to provide himself with
a tasty meal from a convenient stream, being
very fond of fish. He also found some fragments
of meat with which to bait his hooks.
While the others were making ready to start a
small flame in a depression, where it could not
betray them to lurking enemies, Mayhew began
his angling.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the little party the trout were
both hungry and guileless. They had never
had any acquaintance with such a thing as a
fish-hook. Perhaps, once in a long time, some
passing Indian brave may have used his primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
fish spear in order to secure a meal, but
this had failed to educate them in the wiles of
the human race.</p>

<p>And so it came about that presently Mayhew
proudly exhibited a beautiful trout that, being
freshly caught, seemed to glow with all the
colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>“Two more like it would make us all a fine
meal,” said Dick, as he surveyed the prize.</p>

<p>“I can get them, never fear, unless my cunning
has deserted me,” the guide told him, confidently.</p>

<p>It proved that his boast was good, since a
second fish was soon taken, although they had
to wait until almost dark before a third came
to hook.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roger had prepared the two already
captured, and they were all soon being
held over the red coals lying in the hole that
served as a fireplace. Such experienced woodsmen
as the adventurers were knew how to cook
meat and fish without any necessity for a frying-pan.
Nor would they miss salt with which
to season it. A sharp appetite takes the place
of these things in the woods.</p>

<p>Perhaps all of them could have eaten more
had they been given a chance; for, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
trout had been of unusual size, they seemed to
disappear most miraculously, once the hungry
campers started in to make their supper.</p>

<p>This duty done, they faced another dilemma.
How were they to keep warm as they slept?
Accustomed to snuggling down inside their
blankets when the wind whistled, it was not the
nicest outlook to face a night in the open, with
no protection from the chilly air.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that they could not build
a roaring fire to warm them. Had that been
possible, no one could have found any reason
for complaint; but it would be next door to madness,
in the estimation of the borderman, to
have attempted it, with those hostiles not far
away, and ready to creep upon them as they
slept.</p>

<p>Dick noted the rising wind with uneasiness.
It was gradually swinging around so as to come
out of the northwest, too, and that was the point
where the wintry storms came from. When a
gale blew from that quarter, with a sting in
its breath, wise people kept to their cabins, and
declined to venture forth until the worst had
passed.</p>

<p>What would become of them should they be
caught in this open camp, without any fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
destitute of robes or blankets? Dick expected
to hear Roger make some remark bearing on
this matter, at any moment now; for he knew
the other must be beginning to shiver as he
sat in uncomfortable silence, evidently brooding
over the many troubles by which they were
confronted, and trying to see a way out.</p>

<p>Mayhew was prowling about close by. It
was not pitch dark, though one must possess
good eyes in order to see with any degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p>“He’s looking to see if we can better our
condition,” thought Dick, when he had
watched the guide examining a pile of rocks
in the immediate vicinity that may have been
heaped up for some purpose by Indians, years
and years before.</p>

<p>Apparently Mayhew was not finding much encouragement
in his search, for Dick could hear
him muttering rather disconsolately to himself,
though he did not seem disposed to give up
entirely, being possessed of a stubborn nature.</p>

<p>Soon Roger was rubbing his hands one over
the other, which indicated that he felt the cold.
Dick’s mental figuring had produced results,
and he believed a proposition he meant to offer
would strike the others favorably. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
only waiting for Roger to open the subject.</p>

<p>Presently Roger got up on his feet and commenced
to thresh both arms back and forth.
It has always been known as a good means for
starting circulation when the blood is chilled
from inaction; though Roger could not obtain
the best results on account of having to refrain
from making any more noise than was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Dick thought the time had arrived to make
his suggestion. The wind was blowing strongly
by them, with every prospect of a still further
increase in velocity. If it kept up throughout
the night the dawn would turn out to be bitterly
cold; and, unless they were able to find shelter,
they might perish.</p>

<p>“This is an exposed camp, don’t you think,
Roger?” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes, and unless we can have a fire I hate
to think what will happen to us before another
day comes around,” the other replied.</p>

<p>“Then we must make a change,” Dick told
him.</p>

<p>“That is easy to say, but where can we go
that would be better?”</p>

<p>“I know a place,” came the confident reply,
“so get ready to go with me, both of you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>SHELTER FROM THE BITING NORTH WIND</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I am</span> glad to hear you say that, Dick; you
always have some good news when it gets bleak
and black. And from the way I’m shivering I
think the sooner we make a move the better.”</p>

<p>Mayhew had also heard the proposal with interest.
Unfruitful though his own search had
proved, the news that one of the boys had made
some sort of discovery likely to benefit them
sounded good to him.</p>

<p>“Where are going, Dick?” asked Roger, after
they had started. “Unless I’m mistaken we
seem to be on the back trail.”</p>

<p>“Where else could I take you, except to some
place I had seen before?” demanded the new
guide. “But I know you must want to hear
about it, so listen. As we came along I happened
to notice what looked like the mouth of
a cave. If it should turn out that way we can
find shelter within. It might even be possible
for us to light a fire there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Caves are all right on a bad night, too,”
assented Roger. “We know, for haven’t we
made use of one when overtaken by a storm?
I only hope it turns out to be something besides
a little hole in the side of the hill.”</p>

<p>“I have hopes that it will prove to be much
better than that.”</p>

<p>“Is it far away?” continued the other, a little
uneasily, for after their late bitter experience,
when the earth slide robbed them of their packs,
Roger had come to eye their surroundings with
considerable suspicion, and did not much fancy
prowling around there in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Only a few minutes’ walk,” Dick assured
him. “I want to make sure that we do not pass
it by, that is all.”</p>

<p>He devoted himself to the task of keeping
track of the trail as they made their way along.
Even Roger used his eyes the best he knew how,
hoping that he might be of some assistance.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he was glad to hear Dick say,
presently.</p>

<p>Both the others surveyed the spot with considerable
interest. The rock formation was
peculiar in many ways. It looked as though at
some remote period, when the continent was
in process of formation, upheavals had forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
numerous minor ridges of stone to assume the
shape of “hogbacks,” as Mayhew called them.</p>

<p>It was toward one of these that Dick now
pointed. Looking closely, Roger fancied he
could just detect what looked like a dark spot
near its base. He knew then that Dick must
have noted some other land-mark in order to
find the place. No doubt the habit of observation
which the young pioneer cultivated, much
as modern Boy Scouts are taught to do in these
days, had come in handy again, as he had often
known it to do in the past.</p>

<p>They pushed closer. There was an opening
without any doubt. Just what it led to, of
course none of them could more than guess; but
they had hopes.</p>

<p>“One thing let us notice,” ventured Roger.
“Here is a dead tree, and if we find it possible to
build a fire inside we know where to come for
fuel.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Roger,” the other lad hastened
to say. “And now to try and find out
what awaits us here.”</p>

<p>Dick insisted on being the leader. The discovery
had been all his, and it was therefore up
to him to be the guide.</p>

<p>On hands and knees Dick crept carefully into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the hole. He held his gun in such a way that
if it became necessary he could make quick use
of it. So far as he knew there was no peril
hanging over their heads; but it always pays
to be ready.</p>

<p>Their progress was very slow, because they
had to grope their way along. Dick put out
a hand and felt of the rock before trusting himself
to advance. He had no desire to find himself
whirling through space, after the manner
of their lost packs, in case an unseen abyss
yawned in front of him.</p>

<p>This went on for several minutes. They had
pushed some little distance into the gaping aperture,
and so far as could be ascertained there
was as yet no limit to the cave.</p>

<p>Dick arrived at the conclusion that they had
gone far enough to admit of a change in their
method of procedure.</p>

<p>“I am going to strike a light, so keep still,
please, both of you,” he announced.</p>

<p>Dick was always prepared for anything like
this. His tinder, flint and steel were handy,
and he even had a small piece of tallow dip
that hardly deserved the name of candle, but
which had a wick, and would give out a faint
glow if ignited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>To the boy of to-day this awkward means of
producing a light would have presented almost
insurmountable difficulties, and ultimate success
might well be hailed as a wonderful feat.
To the pioneer lads it was of such daily occurrence
that they thought nothing of accomplishing
it.</p>

<p>In a very brief period of time Dick had
clipped his flint and steel together so as to send
a shower of sparks into the tiny bit of inflammable
tinder, which began to smolder. This
was blown until it flamed up, when the wick of
his tallow candle-end was thrust into the
blaze.</p>

<p>Looking around after they had obtained this
sorry means of illumination, the intruders could
see that they were in a good-sized cave. Ahead
of them lay more dense gloom, which would
seem to indicate that the aperture amidst the
rocks extended for an unknown distance beyond.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a pretty good place to put in
the night, when it’s getting cold enough out
there to freeze your toes,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“It’s really comfortable in here,” agreed
Mayhew.</p>

<p>“That’s because the rock is warm, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
have thought to notice it,” Dick explained.</p>

<p>“Now that you mention it,” remarked
Roger, as he again dropped on all fours to find
out for himself, “I see it is a fact. Queer that
I didn’t seem to notice it before. We really
need no fire here, except that this darkness
could almost be cut with a knife.”</p>

<p>“No danger, that I can see, of the light being
observed out there,” Mayhew told them,
thus proving that he, too, was much in favor
of adding to their comfort, if it was to be accomplished
at such a trifling expenditure of
time and labor.</p>

<p>“Shall I crawl out and fetch in some of that
wood, Dick?” asked Roger, and there was such
pleading in his voice and manner that Dick
could not have refused him, even had he wanted
to.</p>

<p>Accordingly Roger crawled away. Since
there was a dim light in the cave he did not find
it so difficult to make his way toward the exit.
Later on he came back, with his arms full of
fuel.</p>

<p>“You get the fire started where you think
best, Dick, while I make another trip for a second
lot. We could keep ten fires supplied, and
not use half the supply outside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Could you see our light out there?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” replied Roger. “The fact
is, I had to do half of my crawling in the dark,
and only got the first glimpse of the light after
I was pretty well inside.”</p>

<p>That took away the last doubt Dick may have
been entertaining with regard to the wisdom of
having a fire.</p>

<p>“It will be easier for you the next time, if I
get things going,” he told the fuel gatherer.</p>

<p>Mayhew, as though feeling that he ought to
have a share in the labor, this time followed the
boy out of the cave, and also picked up a load of
the scattered wood. The tree must have been
struck by lightning at some time in the past,
since the branches covered so much ground.</p>

<p>Dick had the fire well started by the time the
others returned. They could see the light
plainly after passing the mouth of the cave,
although there seemed so little chance of it betraying
their presence that it was hardly worth
considering.</p>

<p>How different things looked, with that cheery
blaze going! The gloom seemed much further
removed than before. And, like the careful boy
that he was, Dick had extinguished his precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
candle-end as soon as its faint light was no
longer needed. Time might yet make that
worth its weight in gold to him, since its like
could only be obtained in some settlement.</p>

<p>An hour later Dick, wishing to find out how
the wind-storm might be progressing, made his
way to the opening and passed out. When he
returned he reported that the stars were still
shining, and it was getting very cold; as for
the wind, it continued to roar across the open
country furiously, now coming out of the north.</p>

<p>“And let me tell you,” he wound up by saying,
“I builded better than I knew at the time
I happened to notice this cave mouth. In here
it is so comfortable one finds it hard to believe
the cold is so intense outside.”</p>

<p>“For folks who have no blankets a cave is a
very fine thing, I must say,” was Roger’s comment.</p>

<p>Of course, almost all of their conversation
was connected with the immediate past, and the
hope they entertained concerning a successful
termination of their hunt for Jasper Williams.</p>

<p>“You did not see anything to tell you the
Indians might be camped near here, I suppose,
Dick?” Roger asked, as the other took his place
once more near the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, although I looked in every direction,”
was the reply. “There is a strange light over
toward the west. You can see it in the sky.
I do not know how to describe it, except that
once, when the forest was afire down on the
Missouri, we saw the same reflection. It may
be there is a prairie burning somewhere down
that way. It would be a fearful sight, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“And picture the buffalo, and the deer, and
everything that runs, fleeing from the flames!”
added Roger, who possessed a lively imagination.
“I heard one of our men by the name of
Fields tell about the time he was caught in such
a fire when far out on the open prairie, hunting
buffalo, and what a narrow escape he had.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember what a strange thing he
did to escape being burned to death,” Mayhew
continued. “It seems that, as running was out
of the question, and the wall of fire was rushing
toward him, Fields discovered a little hollow
in the surface of the prairie. Into that he
crawled, first dragging the buffalo he had just
slain so that it would cover his body, and serve
as a shield against the passing fire.”</p>

<p>“And did he escape without being badly
burned?” asked Dick, deeply interested, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it happened that he had never heard this story
before.</p>

<p>“Nothing worth mentioning, he told me,” the
guide continued. “Few men would have been
so wise as to think of such a thing; but then
Fields is as bright as a button. They say you
can never catch a weasel asleep, and I expect
that would apply to him just as well.”</p>

<p>This man, whom they were talking about, was
one of those whose names have been inscribed
in history on the roll of fame, along with those
of Lewis and Clark, for he accompanied them
on their wonderful journey through thousands
of miles of utterly unknown country, to the far-distant
Pacific, and return.</p>

<p>“How can we find a soft place to lie down
on, please tell me, Dick?” Roger asked, a little
while later, as he ran his hand over the hard
rock, and shook his head as though the prospect
were not very alluring.</p>

<p>Perhaps Dick meant to reply, even though he
could hardly have suggested any amelioration
of the conditions; but, he was not given the
chance to open his mouth, as it happened, for
just then an angry roar sounded close at hand
that made Roger suspect one of those terrible
water-spouts must be about to overwhelm them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
He saw a bulky object come sweeping toward
them from the unexplored interior of the cave,
and then scatter the burning brands as it plowed
through the little fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE BATTLE IN THE CAVE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Instinctively</span> all of them guessed what the
character of the intruder must be. The terrible
roar, and the glimpse they obtained of the
great hairy body ere the fire was scattered right
and left betrayed it.</p>

<p>“A bear!” cried Roger, voicing the discovery
of his companions as well as his own.</p>

<p>All was confusion. Mayhew had been rather
unfortunate, for he chanced to be partly in the
way of the onrushing beast as it made straight
for the fire, the presence of which in its den
must have aroused its anger.</p>

<p>He was just in the act of scrambling to his
feet when he was struck by the beast’s huge
body, and was bowled over just as you may
have seen a pin hit by a speeding ball in the
alley.</p>

<p>Dick had somehow managed to snatch up his
gun when he gained his knees. The place was
now almost in darkness, since the burning
brands had been scattered far and wide. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
body of the infuriated animal was so bulky,
however, that he could not fail to discern its
outlines against the wall, where a still flickering
brand chanced to lie.</p>

<p>The boy knew that it was no time for hesitation.
No matter what had caused the animal
to attack them, and even though the fire had
been the first object of its rage, those who were
responsible for the intrusion must come next
on the list.</p>

<p>He thrust the long-barreled gun straight out,
and, without waiting to rest the butt against
his shoulder, pulled the trigger as soon as he
felt the muzzle strike something yielding.</p>

<p>There was a muffled roar as the rifle was discharged.
Dick, with the hunter instinct, instantly
threw himself aside, anticipating that
the wounded bear would turn upon him for revenge.</p>

<p>His shot had apparently not been a fatal one,
though it brought another of those dreadful
roars from the occupant of the cave; and now,
since it was impossible for him to reload his
gun unless given time, he would have to cast it
aside and resort to his hunting knife.</p>

<p>Roger had not quite lost his senses, although
the abruptness of the attack must have bewildered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the boy. When he threw himself back
out of the way he somehow missed connection
with his gun. That it was ever in his mind
was proved by the frantic way in which he instantly
started to grope about on the bare rock
near his feet, as though in expectation of finding
it.</p>

<p>After all, it was the brilliant flash accompanying
the discharge of Dick’s gun that showed
Roger his own weapon. He quickly seized it,
and then turned to deliver his fire.</p>

<p>All this was taking place in much less time
than it takes to read it. The bear was certainly
in deadly earnest, and evidently meant
to complete the job that had been undertaken
with such fury.</p>

<p>Roger saw his chance to shoot, and was not
neglectful of it. One experience with a monster
of this type had shown him the necessity
for sending his bullet to some vital spot, for
he knew that a wounded grizzly would never
turn tail and run.</p>

<p>A kind fortune must have guided the shot,
for, beyond a doubt, had it failed in its mission,
the fate of the boys would have been settled.
Shut up there in a cave in contact with a savage
bear, armed with claws an inch in length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and rendered wild with pain, they would have
had but small chance of escape.</p>

<p>With the muffled discharge of Roger’s rifle
the beast staggered, and then fell with a crash.
Dick was trying to get a charge of powder into
the barrel of his gun, though his hands trembled
so that it was a next to impossible undertaking.</p>

<p>It happened that just then his foot struck
against some object, and, filled with a wild
hope, he bent down to ascertain what it could
be. When he found that he had come upon
Mayhew’s gun, Dick was ready to shout with
joy, for he knew that, if Roger’s shot had failed,
there was still another chance.</p>

<p>There was no need of further exertions, it
proved. The two shots, delivered at such close
range, had completed the work, for the monster
lay still upon the floor of the cave. A smell of
burning hair caused Dick to pluck one of the
still blazing fagots away, which, with presence
of mind, he immediately utilized for starting a
fresh fire. (<a id="Note_4r"></a><a href="#Note_4">Note 4</a>.)</p>

<p>Mayhew was discovered, sitting up and looking
somewhat dazed. He had a lump on his
head where it had come in contact with the rock
at the time the rush of the bear had thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
him aside; but, on the whole, they felt that they
could congratulate themselves that things were
no worse.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing the boys did was
to reload their weapons. If there was one bear
in the cave there might be a mate, and it was
certainly the part of wisdom for them to be in
readiness to defend themselves to the utmost.</p>

<p>After the fire had been revived, the guns
placed in a condition for service, and Mayhew’s
injuries looked after in a way that, crude as it
might be, satisfied him, they began to figure out
how it all came about.</p>

<p>“Then this is a bear’s den, after all!” Roger
commenced; “yet not one of us ever thought of
such a thing, did we?”</p>

<p>“I saw nothing that would tell it,” admitted
Mayhew, “and, if the beast was in the habit
of coming in by way of the opening that we used
we would have known it. A bear’s den always
has a smell that you will notice as soon as you
enter; that has been my experience in all my
hunting, and I’ve run across a few.”</p>

<p>“Then there must be another entrance more
convenient to the hunting grounds of the bear,”
Dick observed. “The beast may not have been
in its den when we arrived. Coming along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
just a little while ago, our fire attracted attention,
and then the discovery of human beings
here rendered it furious.”</p>

<p>“It beats anything I ever met with,” commented
Mayhew. “No black bear would ever
dash upon a fire unless first terribly wounded.
But this beast was as wild as if we had been
filling her hide with lead.”</p>

<p>“All we have been hearing from the Indians
and the French trappers about these silver-tip
bears of the mountains seems to be true,” remarked
Dick.</p>

<p>“They are fearful enemies,” said Roger.
“We have been lucky to kill the two we have
met; but, if a shot should fail, the hunter would
never escape being torn into ribbons.”</p>

<p>He took up one of the immense paws of the
dead beast as he spoke, and exhibited the claws
that decorated it. They were terrible enough
to send a shudder through the bravest heart,
especially when one considered the titanic
strength possessed by the steel muscles of the
animal.</p>

<p>“Well,” ventured Dick, “it turns out that
there is danger hovering over those who invade
this strange country, even when they believe
themselves securely quartered in a cave!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I hope this little adventure is not going
to make us think of leaving here, to spend the
night under the stars, and in the cold wind?”
Roger hinted, a little fearful lest his comrade
should consider this the wisest policy.</p>

<p>Dick could plainly see what was worrying the
other, and he hastened to set Roger’s fears at
rest.</p>

<p>“If we have to choose between two evils,”
he said, “we might as well take the lesser. We
know what we can expect out there. That wind
is as keen as the edge of my buckhorn hunting
knife, and would go through us long before
morning. And, after all, there may be only
one bear. How about that, Mayhew?”</p>

<p>“If you asked my opinion, I would say here
by all means,” replied the wood ranger, immediately.
“We can take watch and watch, and be
on our guard through the night.”</p>

<p>Roger drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“That would be much better than freezing
half to death outside!” he exclaimed; “and you
can count on me to take my regular turn. But,
Dick, one thing is sure—we must not let our
fire go out while we stay here.”</p>

<p>“That would be only the part of wisdom,”
Dick decided, “and, while we have the chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
perhaps we’d better fetch in plenty of wood
now. The night is long, and a fire eats up a lot
of fuel.”</p>

<p>This they set about doing without delay.
Mayhew, feeling a little dizzy after his rough
experience with the onrushing bear, was told
to stand guard while the boys looked after the
wood supply. It might have been noticed, however,
that both of them slung their guns over
their backs by means of the straps used for
this purpose. Evidently they did not mean to
be caught napping, and if by chance they encountered
the mate of the slain bear while laying
in a supply of fuel they wanted to be in condition
to give him a warm reception.</p>

<p>But nothing happened. If there was a second
bear he must have been far away from his den
on that night, for he failed to disturb the peace
of the explorers’ camp.</p>

<p>The plan of keeping watch by turns worked
splendidly, and there was not a single minute
that one pair of eyes did not remain on the alert
for danger, while two of the party slept.</p>

<p>Hours crept on, and Dick, who had taken his
turn for the second time, believed it must be
drawing close to dawn outside. Roger and the
borderman were sleeping by the fire. Hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
though their beds may have been, they were accustomed
to roughing it, and not a murmur had
been heard. A piece of wood served for a pillow,
and in that warm shelter they needed no
covering.</p>

<p>Creeping to the exit Dick took an observation.
He found it was indeed daylight, and
that the wind had died down with the coming
of the sun, though the air still felt pretty cold
to him, especially after having been in so snug
a retreat for many hours.</p>

<p>It was really time they were up and doing.
The future did not look very promising. They
would have to run the risk of firing their guns,
so as to secure fresh meat, for they must eat
to live. And somewhere within a radius of
ten or twelve miles Jasper Williams might be
found, either in a camp of his own, or as a
prisoner of the hostile Indians.</p>

<p>If ever Dick Armstrong had cause to call
upon his resolute and hopeful heart it was when
he faced such a dismal outlook. Never once
did he falter. His lips were firmly pressed together,
and on his sunburned face there rested
a look of determination that no amount of difficulties
could dissipate.</p>

<p>He immediately awoke the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“The dawn has come, and we must be on the
move!” he announced.</p>

<p>No one uttered a complaint. Roger had, before
going to sleep, managed to remove the terrible
claws of the dead grizzly. That would
be the only token they could show as evidence
of the truth of their story concerning the night
attack, and the fight in the cave.</p>

<p>So they issued forth, shivering at first when
the cold air struck them.</p>

<p>“Good-by, old cave,” said Roger, waving his
hand back toward the small black hole amidst
the rocks, the discovery of which had added
so much to their comfort; “we will never forget
you as long as we live. A bear’s den may
be a queer place to spend a night in; but when
it happens to be a bitter cold night it might be a
whole lot worse.”</p>

<p>They took up the work in earnest, and as all
of them were exceedingly hungry, their first
duty was to secure food. Of course, they might
have food for several days, if they cared to
use the carcass of the dead grizzly, but the
meat was so tough and coarse that, after one
trial at making a breakfast of grizzly steak,
they all agreed that they would rather rely on
the chance of obtaining more palatable food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
If they could only run across a deer it would
supply them with all the meat they wanted for
several days, and, although they realized the
danger of discharging their guns while the hostile
Blackfeet were in the vicinity, they were
willing to run that risk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THANKS TO THE WOLF PACK</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> have you on your mind now, Roger?”
asked Dick, realizing how serious his companion
had become.</p>

<p>As a rule Roger was a light-hearted boy, so
that the change was all the more noticeable
whenever he devoted himself to evolving some
idea that had occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was only thinking how easy it would
be to get all the fresh meat we needed if only
we could stay in one place,” was his reply.</p>

<p>“What sort of fresh meat do you mean?” continued
the other.</p>

<p>“Four different times now,” explained
Roger, “I have seen those big jack-rabbits jump
out of some copse, or a crack in the rocks, and
bound away. Each time, just from force of
habit, my gun would fly to my shoulder, and I
found myself covering the jumper; but of
course I did not mean to pull the trigger.”</p>

<p>“No, because our ammunition is scanty, and,
if we have to fire a shot, we should bag something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
larger than a rabbit. But, Roger, please
go on and explain what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Only this,” the other added; “we could
easily make traps, and snare some of these fat
rabbits if we were in camp. Keeping on as we
do, that’s out of the question. So, in the end,
I suppose we must use our guns to bring down
a deer, or a buffalo, if we have the good luck to
run across one.”</p>

<p>Mayhew came to a full stop just then.</p>

<p>“There is something coming this way!” he
announced.</p>

<p>“It sounds to me as though it was a pack
of excited dogs, or wolves in chase of a breakfast,”
said Roger, after listening a moment.</p>

<p>Dick nodded his head in a fashion that told
that he was of the same opinion. Indeed, as the
sounds were constantly growing louder, there
could be little doubt concerning their origin.
The snapping yelps of wolves in full cry, once
heard, cannot again he easily mistaken. There
is a thrilling import to the sound that goes
through one like a galvanic shock.</p>

<p>“They must he chasing a deer,” Roger hazarded.</p>

<p>“Yes, and heading straight this way!” added
Mayhew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps this is the chance we have been
waiting for,” ventured Roger, as he handled
his gun eagerly.</p>

<p>“No harm done in getting ready, that I can
see,” observed Dick, sagely.</p>

<p>“Let us spread out just a little,” suggested
Mayhew, who, being a veteran hunter, knew
all about the habits of wolves when in pursuit
of their quarry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like that idea,” agreed Dick, “for
they may pass to the right or the left, and then
the one on that side would get a fair shot. Remember,
Roger, take your stand, and after that
be sure not to move. If you did, you might
cause the deer to sheer off, and us to lose our
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Mayhew stood still, while Dick hurried off
to the right, and Roger took to the left, though
neither of them went more than a hundred feet.
In fact the clamor was drawing so close now
that at any minute they might expect to catch
their first glimpse of the chase.</p>

<p>All of them stood like statues, their eyes riveted
on the quarter whence the wild yelps arose.
They could hear the rush of something moving
swiftly through the brush, and the sound grew
constantly in volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a running animal came into view,
a lordly elk, Dick instantly discovered, and a
buck at that. From the manner in which he
ran it was evident that either the elk was lame,
or else had been chased so far that he was becoming
exhausted.</p>

<p>Close at his heels came four ferocious gray
wolves. They were spinning along at top
speed, their red tongues hanging from between
their open jaws, where the white teeth gleamed
cruelly.</p>

<p>The boys had run across another species of
wolf since leaving their old hunting grounds
near the mouth of the Missouri. This was the
smaller prairie wolf, an animal akin to the
coyote. But they saw at a glance that these
were the large, gray timber wolves, more to be
feared than any other species, especially if they
were half starved.</p>

<p>The poor exhausted elk was apparently on
his last legs. He seemed to realize this fact,
too, for, as the boys waited impatiently for the
chase to reach them, they saw him stumble,
and fall to his knees, as he turned to face his
foes.</p>

<p>Instantly the pack leaped upon him. One was
sent whirling through the air, torn by the sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
antlers of the buck; but the others quickly had
the gallant elk down on the ground.</p>

<p>“We must chase them off!” cried Dick, starting
on the run toward the spot.</p>

<p>Roger and the guide followed, so that the
three of them were running as fast as they could
in the direction of the tragedy. They knew
how quickly wolves can tear the carcass of their
quarry, and realized that, if they hoped to save
a portion of the elk’s best quarters, they would
have to hasten.</p>

<p>The wolves quickly discovered their presence;
but they were also very loath to abandon
their feast. Indeed, it seemed for a moment as
though they meant to dispute the right of the
newcomers to the game their cunning and ferocity
had pulled down, for they crouched there,
and growled, and bared their teeth as the trio
approached.</p>

<p>“Be ready to defend yourself, Roger!” called
out Dick, “but do not shoot unless it is absolutely
necessary!”</p>

<p>The wolves realized that they must yield up
their quarry unless they really meant to fight,
which would be foreign to their crafty natures.
Doubtless they knew that man was an enemy
to be feared, even though he might only be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Indian brave, armed with his bow and flint-tipped
arrows.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/i195.jpg" width="318" height="500" alt="wolves reluctantly leaving carcass, three woodsmen looking on" />
<div class="caption">“TURNING AROUND FROM TIME TO TIME AS THOUGH HALF INCLINED TO COME BACK”</div>
</div>

<p>They accordingly retreated, though turning
around from time to time as though half inclined
to come back and have it out with the
spoilers of their well won feast.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you the leavings, never fear,”
laughed Roger, when he saw that there was a
fair portion of the elk still untouched, from
which they could undoubtedly obtain an ample
supply of meat. They set to work with a will,
and soon had obtained all they thought necessary.</p>

<p>All this occurred while the hungry wolves remained
in sight, skulking here and there, sniffing
the air in a beseeching manner, and once
in a while giving vent to a plaintive howl that
sounded strange, indeed, heard in the broad
daylight.</p>

<p>No sooner did the three hunters start to leave
the spot than the eager animals could be seen
turning, their natural sense of caution serving
to hold them back, while the pangs of hunger
urged them on.</p>

<p>“If there had been more of them,” Dick
commented, “the chances are we would not have
been able to take their meat without a fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Even those four might have tried to scare
us off if it was later in the season, when they
are half starved,” Mayhew told them. “Just
now the wolves are fat after the fall, when
hunting is good; that is, fat for their kind.
But, when their flanks seem to almost meet, and
they are gaunt with hunger, they make a terrible
enemy to attack.”</p>

<p>The two lads exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Yes, we know, for we have been through
just such an experience,” said Roger, as he
drew back the sleeve of his hunting tunic, to
exhibit a long, red scar. “That is something
I carry to remind me of the time. I sometimes
dream of it, and can see the terrible mob of
half-crazy wolves leaping up at my throat, while
I did my best to beat them back.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for the coming of some
hunters with their dogs just in the nick of
time,” added Dick, “I think both of us would
have been pulled down and killed by that pack.
It was one of our narrowest escapes.”</p>

<p>“And we have had a good many,” said
Roger, smiling as his memory sped back to
former scenes.</p>

<p>As all of them were very hungry, their one
thought now was to cook some of the happily-secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
meat as soon as it could be arranged.</p>

<p>“Here is as good a place as we can find,”
suggested Dick, “and, unless I am mistaken,
we will be able to get what wood we want without
going far for it.”</p>

<p>“The kind that will make next to no smoke,
you mean!” Roger remarked, and the other
nodded.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of difference in wood.
Well-seasoned stuff of a certain variety will
burn, and give off hardly any smoke; on the
other hand, if the fuel is partly green, or obtained
from a certain species of tree, it will
send up a black column that can be seen a long
way off.</p>

<p>When hunters or Indians wish to communicate
with each other, even though miles apart,
they take this latter kind of wood for their
fire; but, when they desire to do some cooking
while in the enemy’s country, with keen eyes
on the watch around them, it is of course necessary
to attract as little attention as possible,
and on that account the kind of fuel that gives
out no betraying smoke is chosen.</p>

<p>Of course this was what Dick and his two
companions now did; and also the fire was built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in a depression among the rocks so that it might
not be too prominent.</p>

<p>Here they busied themselves cooking small
pieces of the elk meat. Their method of doing
it was exceedingly primitive, for it was thrust
close to the fire by means of long splinters of
wood, and turned around until well scorched,
when it was devoured with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>It requires a vigorous appetite to really enjoy
cooking of this type. Many boys of to-day
would turn up their noses at such food, and go
hungry for a while, though in the end they might
come around and ask for a portion.</p>

<p>They spent half an hour about that small
cooking-fire. At the end of this time all admitted
that they were satisfied, and could not
eat another bite. However, at Dick’s suggestion,
some more of the elk meat was cooked, to
serve them for a “snack” in case circumstances
should not allow them to light a fire later on.</p>

<p>It was Dick who always thought of the future.
Roger, with his happy-go-lucky ways,
was, as a rule, content to consider only present
necessities. When he had eaten, and felt satisfied,
he did not know why any one should borrow
trouble thinking of something far in the future.
In fact, he generally took to heart that passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
he had heard his father read from the Good
Book at home, “sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof,” and applied it to many ordinary
occurrences.</p>

<p>After leaving the place where they had enjoyed
this good breakfast, of which all of them
were in such need, they laid out a course that
would take them to a section of the country that
they had not as yet visited.</p>

<p>All the time they could hear occasional
strange roaring or hissing sounds that aroused
the utmost curiosity, for they did not know at
what moment they would come upon some new
and startling mystery. This enchanted land
was apparently the home of innumerable weird
sights such as a white man had never before set
eyes on; and, as they continued to advance, they
were constantly reminded of this fact.</p>

<p>So, when Roger, who was a trifle in the advance,
called out that they were face to face with
a gigantic “paint pot,” the others held their
breath as they pushed on to see with their own
eyes what he could mean.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE GIANT PAINT POT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was indeed a sight well calculated to make
the boys stare, and rub their eyes in wonder, as
though they half believed they must be dreaming.
If these wonders of Yellowstone Park
elicit cries of delight from tens of thousands of
tourists in these modern times, imagine how remarkable
they must have seemed to these
pioneer lads more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>“When you called it a paint pot, Roger, I
think you hit the bull’s-eye, for it does look like
that, with all those colors boiling up in such a
crazy fashion!” Dick presently remarked,
breaking the spell that seemed to bind them.</p>

<p>“But what is it made of, I’d like to know?”
demanded the puzzled Roger.</p>

<p>“Colored clay, in the shape of mud, that is
boiling all the time. Be careful how you put
your hand to it. See how the steam keeps on
rising. It must be pretty hot stuff!”</p>

<p>“But what makes it boil that way? There
must be a fire of some kind deep down in the
earth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing else would make all these fountains
of hot water, and even the rocks in some places
feel warm,” admitted the other lad, who was
hardly less amazed than Roger himself.</p>

<p>“It must be some sort of volcano,” Roger
continued, thoughtfully. “It has no visible
cone, like most of them do, and so the heat escapes
in this way through hundreds of little
vents.”</p>

<p>That is about the nearest explanation any
scientist has ever been able to give why this one
region in all the world contains innumerable
geysers, hot springs, boiling colored mud pots,
and various other wonders of Nature. (<a id="Note_5r"></a><a href="#Note_5">Note 5</a>.)</p>

<p>“All I can say is that I don’t blame any poor
Injun for believing the place is Evil Ground,”
muttered Mayhew, as he stared at the strange
spectacle of that blue and yellow and green mud
boiling ceaselessly, and throwing off steam that
had a peculiar odor, unlike anything they had
ever smelled before.</p>

<p>He looked around him, and shrugged his
shoulders. So many remarkable things were to
be seen, such as a frontiersman might well view
with alarm, that it was no wonder Mayhew felt
uneasy. Left to his own devices he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
turned his back on this enchanted region, and
considered himself a lucky man if only he might
get away with his life.</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” Dick observed, “that we need
not hope to find Williams anywhere about here,
if, as we fear, he has been taken prisoner by
those Blackfoot Indians.”</p>

<p>“No, because they would never come to a
place like this, unless their old medicine man
was along to make a palaver with the Evil
Spirit,” Roger suggested. “That is what I
heard a Mandan brave say, and I guess it must
be about so. We will have to go further, and
look for Jasper elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Mayhew seized upon this hint to make a start,
and, noticing how anxious the scout seemed to
be to shut out the strange spectacle of that ever
boiling pool of gayly tinted mud, the boys followed
at his heels.</p>

<p>“I can hear other spouting fountains not far
away!” declared Roger. “Sometimes it is like
a giant snake hissing, and then again I seem to
catch a distant but terrible roaring sound,
reminding me of that fierce bear in the
cave.”</p>

<p>“Even if the winter is coming on here, there
are plenty of birds still to be met with,” Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
remarked, as a flock of cawing crows started up
from a tree-top near by, and flew away.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are hawks also, and I am sure I
saw a pair of great bald-headed eagles soaring
away up in the sky, wheeling in circles as they
rose. Besides, we have stirred up many of
those brush fowl that are so much like our
chickens at home, and make such fine eating.”</p>

<p>“It would be a great place for a hunter or a
trapper to spend the winter,” Mayhew commented,
“if only he could get used to the awful
things there are going on in this beautiful section
of country. You see, the snow must soon
melt where there is so much heat; and that keeps
the grass green for the deer and the buffalo.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Roger, stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>His face lighted up with eagerness, and Dick
was filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>“What did you think you heard?” he asked,
presently.</p>

<p>“The signal we want to catch more than anything
else,” came the confident reply.</p>

<p>“Not the whistle Jasper Williams taught us
to practice, Roger, and which he uses when he
wants to communicate with friends?”</p>

<p>“That, and nothing else, Dick. I am sure I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
caught it, coming from somewhere over to the
right.”</p>

<p>“Then why not answer it?” Dick told him.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be wise?” asked the
other.</p>

<p>“We want to know if Jasper Williams is
near by, and that is the best way to find it out.
You can give the whistle, Roger, for I have
heard you practice it many times.”</p>

<p>For answer Roger puckered up his lips, and
emitted a peculiar little trill. Should any one
not familiar with it hear this sound, he would
naturally imagine some bird was calling to its
mate.</p>

<p>All of them stood there, eagerly waiting to
discover if Roger’s note called forth any response.
Before ten seconds had passed there
came a faint whistle, very like that which the
boy had given.</p>

<p>“There, did you hear it, Dick?” gasped
Roger, turning a flushed face toward his cousin,
while his eyes sparkled joyously.</p>

<p>“I heard a sound that might be just such a
whistle as Jasper taught us,” replied cautious
Dick; “but don’t build too many castles in the
air, Roger, or you may be disappointed. Try
again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger was only too willing to do so, and there
was an immediate reply this time, that all of
them heard plainly.</p>

<p>“He’s coming this way, I do believe, for that
was closer than before. Shall I give him another
call?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it can do no harm, and we must know
the truth, at any rate.”</p>

<p>When the next answer came back it was beyond
all doubt nearer than any that had preceded
it.</p>

<p>“Oh! we shall soon see him!” cried Roger,
fixing his eyes on the spot, as near as he could
calculate, whence that last reply had come.
“Now, keep watching, both of you, while I
signal to him again that the coast is clear.”</p>

<p>He added one more tremulous trill to his
notes; to his astonishment the answer was so
plain and clear that it seemed to come straight
out of a pine tree not more than twenty-five
yards away.</p>

<p>“Why, he must be back of that tree, I think!”
stammered Roger, uneasily, for he realized that
Jasper Williams could never have gained such a
Position without some of their eyes detecting
his advance.</p>

<p>Just then a bird flew out of the pine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
alighted in another at some distance away in
another quarter. Dick himself instantly gave
the signal whistle, and there came an immediate
answer; but it was now from the quarter
whither the bird had flown.</p>

<p>Roger gave a cry of disgust, while Dick
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Good-by to Jasper this time, I’m afraid,
Roger!” he said.</p>

<p>“How mean that was for a silly little bird to
have the same whistle Jasper had made up as
his signal,” said Roger, looking downcast.
“Come, there’s no use in our staying here any
longer. If that bird keeps on whistling I might
feel like using my gun to bring it down, for I’d
think it was mocking me.”</p>

<p>“The poor thing thought a mate was calling,”
Dick assured him; “or else some other male bird
that wanted to fight it. I warrant you, it is just
as upset as you can be over the mistake.”</p>

<p>They pushed on once more, and inside of two
hours had come upon at least seven more geysers,
some of which were spouting, while others
were quiet at the time the three pilgrims happened
to find the craters.</p>

<p>Now and then the boys would converse in low
tones, for Dick knew that this was the best way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to keep his companion’s spirits from drooping.</p>

<p>When other things failed, Dick could always
interest him by referring to the wonderful luck
that had befallen them, in giving them a chance
to stay all winter at the Mandan village with the
exploring expedition, so as to go on into the
Golden West when spring came around.</p>

<p>The uncertainty that lay ahead seemed to appeal
to the spirit of adventure that lay deep
down in the hearts of the young pioneers.</p>

<p>“When we break camp in the spring and leave
here,” Dick went on, as though he had mapped
it out in his mind, “we will have to head into the
Northwest, Captain Lewis told me.”</p>

<p>“Why go that way instead of straight into the
West, or turn toward the Southwest?” Roger
asked him, just as Dick knew he would be likely
to do.</p>

<p>“It seems that the two captains have been
picking up all the information they can from
every source,” Dick explained; “and this, when
boiled down, causes them to believe there is a
better opening over the great Rocky Mountain
chain up there than in any other quarter. Besides,
I believe they have an idea there is a great
river that flows to the sea, the headwaters of
which start in the land of the Blackfeet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“He must have gotten some of that information
from the Blackfoot prisoner the Mandans
have in their strong lodge?” suggested Roger,
quickly.</p>

<p>“I believe he did,” Dick told him. “I happen
to know that both the captains and an interpreter
spent many hours with the Blackfoot.
And I also heard that they had promised to
take the man back to his people with them in the
spring; for they were giving the Mandans some
presents to coax them to turn him over to
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! just to think, Dick, what it will mean to
us, if we are with them when they first set eyes
on the big water! Our parents came from the
far East, where they knew the Atlantic Ocean;
and, if we could only see the other, what a
feather it would be in our caps when we got back
home.”</p>

<p>Dick had accomplished his purpose, for his
cousin showed his old-time enthusiasm again.
So they continued to converse as they followed
Mayhew, who strode along in advance, constantly
on the alert for some new and startling
sight, and not at all pleased with his surroundings.</p>

<p>It was after noon had come and gone that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
uttered a cry that the boys understood as a command
to halt. Each clutched his gun in the
manner of those who know the value of being
ready.</p>

<p>“Look away off yonder, up on the low ridge!”
said the guide, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Moving figures, and of men at that!” ejaculated
Roger.</p>

<p>“Indians, I take it,” said Dick; “for I can
see the feathers in their hair, and the sun seems
to glisten from their painted bodies. They
must be on the warpath, to have put the paint
on, and the feathers, too.”</p>

<p>“But look, Dick, there is one of them who
wears clothes like a white trapper or borderman!”
declared the excited Roger. “Do you
see what I mean, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it certainly looks that way,” answered
the other boy, shading his eyes with his hand in
order to see better. “It <i>is</i> a white man, too,
for he is wearing some kind of fur cap, and his
hunting shirt is fringed like our own. There,
he turned his face this way then, and he is no
Indian, I am as certain as that my name is Dick
Armstrong!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A SUDDEN PERIL</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span> they have gone!” said Roger, as the
figures, outlined against the sky, vanished behind
some outcropping rock.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they seemed to be starting down
the side of the ridge toward us, as near as I
could see,” Dick declared, nor did the guide
dispute the assertion.</p>

<p>“Could that have been our friend Jasper
Williams?” demanded Roger, voicing the vague
hope that was pounding at his own heart door.</p>

<p>“He was too far away for us to make sure,
one way or another,” admitted Dick.</p>

<p>“But he seemed to be of about the same build;
and, Dick, you could see nothing to prove that it
was any one else, could you?”</p>

<p>“No, only that he was in the company of
Indians,” and Dick shook his head in a way
that spoke of considerable doubt.</p>

<p>“But then,” argued Roger, “they might be
friendly Mandans, or Sioux, or even some of
these Sheep-eaters we’ve heard about, who live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in certain sections of the Wonderland in brush
shacks.” (<a id="Note_6r"></a><a href="#Note_6">Note 6</a>.)</p>

<p>“Yes, that might be true, for they were too
far away for us to tell from the feathers in their
scalp-locks what tribe they belonged to,” the
other boy admitted.</p>

<p>“And the last thing we heard about Jasper,
from Hardy and Mordaunt, was that he was
being chased by Blackfoot Indians,” Roger continued.</p>

<p>“Well,” Dick explained, “this white man was
no prisoner, for I saw him point ahead at something,
which would mean that his arms were not
fastened.”</p>

<p>“We know that Williams is a remarkable
man,” mused Roger, “and, even if those braves
were of the fierce Blackfoot tribe, he might have
managed in some way to have made them his
friends. I know it doesn’t sound reasonable,
but Jasper knows Indian character better than
any white man we ever met.”</p>

<p>“If he could do that he would be a magician.”</p>

<p>“So he would,” admitted the other boy, reluctantly;
“but what are we going to do about
it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing for us but to wait and see,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
came the reply. “They acted as though heading
in this direction. If you asked me about
our best move I’d say, hide and watch. If it
turned out to be Jasper we could call out; on
the other hand, if it were one of these French
trappers, who are hand in glove with the Blackfoot
Indians, we needn’t let them know we are
around.”</p>

<p>“But do you think they noticed us?” asked
the other boy.</p>

<p>“That is more than I can say. I saw nothing
to indicate it; but these redskins are so tricky
they would hide it, even if they knew, and were
watching us out of the tail of their eyes.”</p>

<p>“Let us hide, and see!” Mayhew said just
then, showing that he approved of Dick’s
scheme.</p>

<p>Looking around, they quickly decided where
it would be best to conceal themselves. The
ground was so rough and uneven that there
were plenty of places that had an inviting look.
Mayhew selected a patch of bushes as a retreat,
and in another minute they were crouching under
this shelter.</p>

<p>Although most of the leaves were off the
bushes, they grew so densely that it would require
something more than a casual glance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that direction to betray the fact that several
figures lurked there.</p>

<p>They heard many different sounds, for silence
was hardly ever present in this land of the
spouting wells, which roared and hissed and
spluttered as they shot up their steaming fountains
toward the heavens. There was almost
constantly a fretful murmur in the air that
might suddenly turn into a whining shriek or
a dull roar.</p>

<p>A low exclamation from Mayhew announced
that his trained vision had detected some sort
of movement, far or near.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Roger, on the right
of the guide.</p>

<p>“They are coming!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Tell us where, that we may see also,” the
other urged.</p>

<p>“Then turn this way, and look between those
two leaning trees,” said the guide. “But be
careful that you move slowly. It is the quick actions
that catch the suspicious eye of an Injun.”</p>

<p>“Oh! now I can see them plainly,” whispered
Roger. “They are heading straight for us!”</p>

<p>“Blackfoot warriors for a certainty!” Dick
muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you see the white man plainly, Dick?”
asked Roger, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” came the reply. “He must
be back among some of the Indians who hide
him. But we will soon know what to expect.
Keep watching.”</p>

<p>Almost immediately Roger himself gave a
grunt. It sounded as though bitter chagrin
was connected with the sound.</p>

<p>“There, I saw him plainly, Dick,” he whispered,
“and it isn’t Jasper Williams at all.
The man is a Frenchman, unless my eyes deceive
me, and I ought to know what one of them
looks like.”</p>

<p>“I believe it is none other than our old enemy,
François Lascelles!” Dick said in the ear of his
cousin; a bit of information that must have
given poor Roger a strange thrill, for he could
not have imagined any more discouraging
news.</p>

<p>“Oh! what if he runs across us here?”</p>

<p>“We would have to fight for our lives, I
fear. That man hates all our family about as
bitterly as I’ve heard my father say another
Frenchman named Jacques Larue once did.”</p>

<p>“But see how many there are of the Indians;
a full dozen or more. They look as fierce as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
braves I ever saw. I hope they pass by, and
fail to notice us.”</p>

<p>“Keep still, Roger, they are getting too close
now for us to talk, even in whispers. Be ready
for the worst, even while hoping for the best.
That is the Armstrong motto, you know. ’Sh!”</p>

<p>Roger fixed himself so that he could see everything
that went on without making the slightest
movement. He knew those keen eyes of the red
sons of the forest were quick to detect a suspicious
movement, no matter how slight, and
that, if he so much as lifted his hand, discovery
would follow.</p>

<p>The Indians were coming forward in a string,
or what the trappers of that day called “Indian
file,” one stepping in the footprints of the
brave ahead of him. In this fashion it would be
difficult for any enemy on finding their trail to
know whether three or twenty had passed. It
was a piece of Indian cunning, and a part of
their nature, since it could hardly have been
undertaken for any particular reason at this
time.</p>

<p>They were heading directly toward the copse,
but, since it would offer a bar to their progress,
they might turn aside when it was reached.</p>

<p>The boys almost held their breath as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
watched the approach of those fierce-looking
Blackfeet. Up to then the brave who was held
a prisoner in the Mandan village had been the
only member of this noted tribe they had seen
at close quarters. (<a id="Note_7r"></a><a href="#Note_7">Note 7</a>.)</p>

<p>They were all picked men, if one could judge
from their appearance; they were lithe, active
as cats, alert, and at the same time muscular.
Those swelling bronzed arms could doubtless
paddle a dugout or a skin canoe at tremendous
speed. Among them there must be braves who
had won an enviable reputation for speed at foot
races; or, it might be, renown as long distance
runners, capable of keeping on the trail at a dog-trot
for days and nights at a time.</p>

<p>It was therefore with considerable respect,
and not a little anxiety as well, that Dick and
Roger watched them coming nearer.</p>

<p>Of course they took note of the white man,
too. He was a bold-looking adventurer, such
as most of those French traders of the early
century were, dashing in appearance, and with
a certain air of recklessness about him, such
as might be expected in those who daily took
their lives in their hands and faced unknown
perils in a wilderness that was almost a complete
mystery to white men of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>François Lascelles had entered largely into
the lives of these two boys, even though their
opportunities to see the wily and unscrupulous
French trader had been few, up to then, and
mostly at their home, where he visited to talk
business with their parents.</p>

<p>If they had not liked his looks at that time he
certainly presented a far less prepossessing appearance
now that he was away from all the
outposts of civilization and saw no need to repress
the tiger element in his nature.</p>

<p>To himself Dick was saying:</p>

<p>“That man would stop at nothing in order to
have his own way. If ever we had the bad luck
to fall into his power we could not expect any
mercy, I am sure. And, if Jasper Williams
is now in his hands, nothing can save him, unless
we are fortunate enough to be able to come
to his rescue.”</p>

<p>This far Dick had arrived in his train of
thought when he received a sudden and severe
shock. Mayhew had managed to give his foot
a slight kick, as though to call his attention
to something that was going on out in the open.
Dick hardly required this signal to pay attention,
for he had already seen what was happening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians were no longer pushing forward
as before. The one in the lead had suddenly
stopped up; and he must have given vent to
some exclamation that acted like magic on the
rest, for every one had halted as though controlled
by a single wire.</p>

<p>They seemed to be gathering around their
leader, who was pointing excitedly to the
ground, as though he had made an important
discovery.</p>

<p>Mayhew grunted very softly, but the sound
lost none of its significance on account of being
so gently emitted. As for Dick, he did
not need to be told what it was the Blackfoot
had found; for, like a flash, it came to him that
he and his companions had headed toward the
clump of bushes from that very spot.</p>

<p>The sharp eyes of the leading brave had discovered
their trail! It had been a fatal blunder,
their neglecting to cover this up in some manner,
although, at the time, it might have seemed
as though there was not one chance in a thousand
the hostiles would come that way.</p>

<p>No one moved, even though they must have
felt hot and cold by turns, as the terrible result
of the discovery flashed before their minds.
The Indians were jabbering together in excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tones, though what they were saying the boys
could only guess, since they knew nothing of
the Blackfoot tongue.</p>

<p>The white trader was apparently as curious
as any of the dusky braves in his company. He
even dropped down on his hands and knees, the
better to examine the footprints. Of course it
would be patent to them that the tracks were
made by white men.</p>

<p>What would be the result? Would they surmise
that the three daring invaders of the Evil
Manitou’s Wonderland, the forge where he
made all his thunderbolts, must be secreted
near by? Could they read that those tracks had
just been made, since blades of brown grass
were still springing up after being pressed
down?</p>

<p>Perhaps Lascelles even knew that Dick and
Roger were searching for Jasper Williams! He
seemed to be superhuman when it came to learning
things that were supposed to be secret.
And, if that were so, then it was indeed a gloomy
outlook that faced the pioneer boys.</p>

<p>Dick could only catch his breath and watch to
see what would happen next; that, and grip his
gun tighter in his hands as he crouched waiting
for the explosion. He knew their presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the copse was suspected, for the trader was
even then pointing straight at the patch of
bushes, and saying something to his red companions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>PRISONERS OF THE BLACKFEET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Flight</span> was out of the question, for the boys
could hardly hope to excel those fleet-footed Indian
braves, however successful Mayhew might
have proved.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was little time given to any of
them to think of escape. When the wily French
trader had conveyed his suspicions to some of
the Blackfoot braves there was a concerted dash
toward the clump of bushes.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians started to circle around,
evidently in the expectation that, if the whites
were concealed, they would attempt flight, and
the idea of these runners was to forestall any
such dash.</p>

<p>“We must hold them back or all is lost!”
exclaimed Mayhew, who, being an experienced
Indian fighter, doubtless knew the weak and
strong points of the red men, no matter to what
tribe they belonged.</p>

<p>The report of his long-barreled rifle followed
his words almost instantly. There could be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
question but that his bullet found its billet, for
Mayhew was a crack shot.</p>

<p>Roger strained his eyes to discover the form
of Lascelles among those rushing straight toward
the bushes, but he looked in vain. The
shrewd Frenchman must have suspected that he
would be a shining mark for the concealed riflemen,
and hence he had discreetly taken shelter
behind a convenient tree trunk, from whence he
could observe all that went on, and be ready
to appear after the battle was over. Failing
to see Lascelles, Roger took hasty aim at the
nearest Indian and fired, but apparently missed.</p>

<p>Dick had not thought about trying for the
trader; indeed, it might have been the most
foolish thing Roger could have done, since the
Indians, if successful, would probably dispatch
the boys without hesitation, unless there was a
restraining hand put out to prevent it.</p>

<p>The tricky warriors came leaping and dodging
to the attack, so that it was not the easiest
thing in the world to hit such an eccentric target.
When Dick fired he felt sure he had not
missed, and yet his intended victim failed to fall,
though he did act as though wounded.</p>

<p>The guns being now empty the boys drew
their pistols. These of course were of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
construction, being furnished with flint locks.
It required considerable knack to be able to discharge
such a weapon. The powder had to be
shaken afresh into the pan, or there would be no
explosion after the flint and steel had come violently
in contact. Then, unless the connection
were assured through the minute hole, it would
result only in a flash in the pan, instead of the
weapon doing its full duty.</p>

<p>Roger, always more careless than Dick,
snapped his pistol in vain, for there was no report.
Perhaps it was just as well, since, in the
end, one enemy more or less would have made
very little difference.</p>

<p>By this time the Indians were upon them, and
each one of the little party found himself in the
midst of a whirling force that frustrated all
their wild efforts to strike with knife or hatchet.</p>

<p>From a point close at hand a shrill voice was
screaming orders in the Indian tongue. François
had come to life suddenly, after making
sure that the whites could no longer cover him
with their fire-arms. He was ordering his red
minions not to finish the three palefaces, if they
expected to obtain the reward he had promised
them.</p>

<p>All this the boys heard as in a dream. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
were so furiously engaged at the time, it was
little attention they paid to anything that was
going on. To avoid the savage blows aimed at
them by dusky hands that gripped stone tomahawks,
was about as much as they could manage.
It was only later on, when they had a
chance to exchange views concerning the fight,
that they reached such a conclusion.</p>

<p>Such an unequal contest could not last long.
Dick and Roger were pulled to the ground by the
many hands that gripped them. Struggling to
the bitter end, they expected that some one of
their red antagonists would finish them with a
fell sweep of those flourished tomahawks; indeed,
Dick shut his eyes in anticipation of such
a tragedy, and before his inward vision there
flashed one glimpse of the dear ones in the far
distant home on the bank of the Missouri.</p>

<p>But the blow did not fall. He could hear the
excited voice of Lascelles haranguing the braves,
and, opening his eyes again, Dick found that the
French trader had interposed his arm between
the threatening weapons and the two boys.</p>

<p>Just what François was saying to his allies
Dick could not tell, since he knew little of Indian
talk, and nothing at all of the Blackfoot language.
He could, of course, guess that Lascelles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
for some reason of his own, did not wish
the boys slain. It could hardly have been pity
that influenced the trader, for he was a cruel
man.</p>

<p>Dick became aware of several other things
just then. One was that Roger was keeping up
his vain struggling, despite the fact that a
couple of brawny braves were sitting on
him.</p>

<p>“Keep still, Roger,” commanded Dick, realizing
that the impulsive lad was imperiling both
of their lives by his senseless actions; “you
can never break away, and by keeping up that
fighting you may force them to knock us on the
head. We are prisoners, and there is no help
for it.”</p>

<p>Roger stopped his writhing and beating with
his fists, though the fact that he had to yield to
the inevitable forced a groan from his lips.</p>

<p>“Where is Mayhew?” asked Dick, noting that
the scout did not seem to be near.</p>

<p>Before Roger could frame any sort of a reply
they heard a series of yells from a little distance,
followed by a shot.</p>

<p>“He must have managed to break away,
Dick,” exclaimed Roger, when he could get rid
of the dirt that impeded his speaking; “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
some of the Indians have followed after him.
Oh, I hope he has not been killed!”</p>

<p>“That didn’t sound like it,” Dick told him.
“There was a deal of baffled fury in those Indian
yells. Mayhew may get clear away, after
all. He has no equal as a runner among all the
men of the expedition.”</p>

<p>There was no time to say more, nor were the
conditions by which the two boys were surrounded
of a nature to invite conversation.</p>

<p>Lascelles had apparently convinced those of
the Indians who seemed most bent on finishing
the white boys that it would be more to their
advantage to hold them as prisoners or hostages,
for reluctantly they dropped their uplifted
weapons. That more than one of them did
this under protest could be seen from the manner
in which they eyed the prisoners, and shook
their feather bedecked heads.</p>

<p>“Get up, you American swine!” said Lascelles,
accompanying his remark with a kick
from the toe of his moccasin.</p>

<p>As there was no longer a weight on his chest
Roger sprang to his feet as though he had been
shot up by a gigantic spring. His face was
white with anger, and he would have leaped
straight at the throat of the insulting French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
trader, despite the fact of Lascelles holding a
leveled pistol in front of him, only that Dick
seized hold and held him back.</p>

<p>“You are crazy to think of that, Roger!
Have some sense. Think of those at home,
and do nothing to force his hand!”</p>

<p>It was a terrible task for the hot-blooded boy
to subside. He gave Lascelles a look that spoke
volumes, but which only caused the Frenchman
to grin in pleasure, for he had no idea that
these boys would ever be given the chance to
turn the tables on him.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had been badly hurt in
the fierce scrimmage, though scratches and
minor cuts were in evidence, and they looked the
worse for wear. Deprived of every weapon,
they were helpless in the midst of that circle
of hostile Blackfeet, and could only grit their
teeth and give back look for look in a resolute
fashion.</p>

<p>Lascelles stood before them, with folded arms,
and a sneer on his dark face. From a point still
more remote there came again those yells of
baffled rage to tell that the skillful Mayhew
must still be eluding his pursuers.</p>

<p>“So, zis is ze young Armstrongs zat I haf ze
pleasure to entertain?” the trader started to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
say, as though he had a communication to make
which he fancied would add still more to their
wretchedness, and it was necessary to first of all
“break the ice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are the Armstrong boys, and you
are François Lascelles,” replied Dick. “What
business have you trying to make us prisoners?
We are not interfering with these Indians in
their hunting grounds. The last time we saw
you it was at the cabin of our grandfather,
David Armstrong. Why do you not order these
warriors to set us free? We will go back to the
camp from which we came, and they will not
see us again.”</p>

<p>“Eet is not to be as you wish, but as I say,” the
Frenchman observed, with a pompous inflation
of his chest, as became a victor. “I haf you in
my power, and zat ees vat I am here for. Eef
you evair return to ze home again eet vill not be
until ze winter is gone. Zen eet vill be too late
to take ze leetle paper to zose zat sit by ze fireside,
and wait day by day for you to come back!”</p>

<p>At hearing this Dick felt considerable relief.
Perhaps, after all, the Frenchman was not quite
so bad a man as he had believed. He spoke as
though there might be a possibility of their being
kept prisoners through the winter, and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
free in the spring, when it was no longer possible
for them to reach home before the time
limit had expired, and their parents ousted from
their property.</p>

<p>That would mean that long months must
elapse. They might even be taken to the Blackfoot
village, leagues and leagues away, but there
would always remain a chance for escape.
Dick was a firm believer in the old motto that
“while there’s life there’s hope.”</p>

<p>“You know why we are here in this strange
land, then?” he remarked, chiefly to draw the
other out, so that something might be learned
concerning the whereabouts of Jasper Williams.</p>

<p>“Yes, eet is all plain to me vy you come
here,” Lascelles assured him, nodding as he
spoke. “I haf made sure zat ze paper you
could nevaire secure. I haf already ze Williams
a prisoner in anuzzer camp, vere my son Alexis
and ze brave French comrades zay watch heem
like ze weasel.”</p>

<p>“You mean that Jasper Williams is a prisoner,
do you?” asked Dick, while Roger listened
eagerly, trying to read the grinning countenance
of Lascelles, and determine whether he was
speaking the truth, or concocting a lie for some
evil purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Zat ees vat I am saying,” continued Lascelles;
“I haf arranged zat he may be taken to ze
village of Black Otter, and adopted into ze
tribe. Ze big chief haf long wished to haf ze
white man show zem many things zat zey do not
know. Williams nevaire come back from ze
Blackfoot country. Eet is many days’ journey
into ze cold Northwest, and no white man has
ever seen the wigwams of Black Otter.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do with us; I hope you
will not send us with the Blackfeet also?” asked
Dick, still seeking information.</p>

<p>“I haf not yet made up my mind, but pouf!
vat does it matter to me? So zat you may not
send ze word down to ze town on zat Missouri
I care not vat becomes of ze Armstrong vermin.
I haf Williams, and now both ends zey are tied
up. Zat ees well!”</p>

<p>“You will have to prove it before I believe
Williams is your prisoner!” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Ah! zat ees easy,” retorted the Frenchman;
“you haf seen zis knife in hees possession, it
may be. Do you not recognize eet? Williams
think so much of zat knife he would not let it
leave hees person. But I haf eet here. So you
see zere ees ze proof zat he ees a prisoner in zat
uzzer camp.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>BINDING UP AN ENEMY’S WOUNDS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Do</span> you believe him, Dick?” asked Roger,
huskily, after the French trader had turned his
back on them, and the Indians busied themselves
binding the hands of their captives behind their
backs, using deerskin thongs for the purpose.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it must be so,” replied Dick. “I
happen to know about that knife, and have
heard Williams say he prized it above anything
he possessed. It has saved his life more than
once, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Then if you recognized the knife it would
mean that he is a prisoner like ourselves,” admitted
Roger, with a long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>“We may be taken to where he is being kept,”
the other told him.</p>

<p>“They say misery likes company.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you must never give in like that. I tell
you it is bound to come out right in the end,
though things may look dark just now. Such a
bad man could not win out ultimately. Do as I
am doing and refuse to allow yourself to think
such a thing can happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“I try to—honestly I do, Dick; but what hope
have we now? Here we are in the power of that
rascal, who means to see to it that we do not get
free until spring, and even then he may leave
us to our fate. And, as if that were not enough,
Jasper Williams, the only one who can save our
parents’ homes, is a prisoner and will be sent
into the wilderness, never to be seen again.”</p>

<p>Dick could understand what a weight rested
on the mind of his cousin. Was he not himself
fighting against the same depression, and conquering
it only because he would not give in?</p>

<p>“Listen, Roger,” he said, impressively,
“there is only one way for us to win this fight,
and that is by making up our minds nothing can
ever best us. Brace up, and shut your teeth
together in the old way.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me for giving in so soon; you are
curing me fast now. I already feel that things
are never so dark but that they might be worse.”</p>

<p>“Much worse,” Dick told him, resolutely.
“Whenever you feel your knees beginning to
get weak under you, just shut your eyes and see
father, mother and little Mary sitting by the
fireside at home. It will do wonders. I know,
for I have often tried it myself.”</p>

<p>By this time the Indians had finished binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
their arms behind them. Evidently they expected
to go to some other place to camp.</p>

<p>The day was not far from its close. Dick
wondered whether they were to be taken to the
place where Jasper Williams was being held
prisoner. Lascelles had said it was a camp
where his son Alexis and some other Frenchmen
were in charge, showing that he must wield
considerable influence over the warlike Blackfeet.</p>

<p>There was nothing to indicate what the result
of the pursuit of Mayhew had been, up to the
time they started forth. This in itself gave the
boys a faint hope the guide might have eluded
his pursuers. They had considerable faith in
Mayhew, and believed that he would not desert
them.</p>

<p>Still, what could one man do against such
a legion of enemies, and especially when in almost
as much fear of the wonders of that enchanted
region as the superstitious Indians
themselves?</p>

<p>Some of the Indians walked ahead, while
others brought up the rear, once they started.
Dick was curious enough to take note of the
course they pursued. He had a dogged faith
to believe that sooner or later he would want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to know something about this ground, for he
hoped to tread it again on the return journey
to the explorers’ camp.</p>

<p>It was, he found, a difficult task to keep
track of their passage. This was chiefly caused
by the meanderings of the Indians. Whenever
they fancied they were approaching one of the
spouting wells, with its steam column, and its
roaring voice, they would sheer off to one side,
and circle around it.</p>

<p>All this made their course an eccentric one,
and Dick found it beyond his power to figure
it out. All he could do was to note the general
direction in which they were heading, and store
it away in his memory for future use.</p>

<p>Roger was close enough to him to allow of
an occasional interchange of remarks. Their
captors seemed to pay no attention to what
they were saying; and of course none of them
understood a word of it, so the boys saw no
need of restricting themselves when discussing
their hopes and fears.</p>

<p>“I believe they intend to camp before long,”
Dick said presently, as they continued to move
along through the pine-clad side of the slope
that rose to form a foothill to the mountain
chain further away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the sun is only setting, and these Indians
never get tired, so what makes you think
they will halt?” Roger asked, himself very
weary.</p>

<p>“But Lascelles is not anxious to keep going
when there is no need,” explained the other
prisoner. “I saw him point out a spot to the
tall Indian at his side, who must be a sub-chief
from the feathers in his scalp-lock, and the
bears’ claws he carries about his neck. The
Indian shook his head, and pointed ahead, as
if he meant that he knew of a much better
place to spend the night.”</p>

<p>“I hope there’s a bubbling spring there, and
that it’s ice-cold,” ventured Roger, “for I’m
dry as a bone, and somehow most of the water
up here is luke-warm, when it isn’t nearly boiling.”</p>

<p>“There was that one place we struck,” Dick
remarked, “where a cold stream ran so close
to one of the hot pools that I really believe
you could catch a trout in the one, give it a
swing over your head, and drop it in the other
so it would be cooked without being taken off
the hook.”</p>

<p>“I can see what the folks at home will do
and say when you tell that yarn,” observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Roger, with a faint chuckle, as though for the
moment he had forgotten their predicament.</p>

<p>“Look, there are three other Indians waiting
for us by that dead tree!” Dick suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>“One of them is wounded in the shoulder,
too!” remarked Roger. “Oh! Dick, can those
be the men who pursued Mayhew?”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking about that myself,” returned
the other; “and, now that you ask me,
I must say I believe they are. That one certainly
has been struck by a bullet. See how
crudely they have bandaged the wound. If they
would let me try my hand I could do a heap
better.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell that to Lascelles,” suggested
Roger, quickly. “It might make us
friends among the Indians, and goodness knows
we need them. Besides, I never liked to see
even an Indian suffer.”</p>

<p>“I remember hearing my father tell how,
long years ago, when they were living up on
the bank of the Ohio, they found a young Indian
badly wounded, and took him into their
camp to nurse. Some of the settlers, who believed
that every Indian was a snake in the
grass, wanted to put him to death, but father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and uncle had their way, and Blue Jacket’s
life was spared.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, “and ever afterwards
he was the best friend the settlers had. Why,
he even followed our parents most of the way
down to the Mississippi, when they descended
the Ohio River on a flatboat. And then another
time, you remember, they won the good will
of the great Indian chief, Pontiac, by saving
his life.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact, Roger; and he gave them
a wampum belt that kept them from the fury
of the Indian ever afterwards. Some people
may not think it pays to befriend an Indian,
but we have been taught differently.”</p>

<p>When the three Indians joined the main
column Dick tried to ascertain whether they had
been successful in their pursuit of Mayhew, or
had met with failure.</p>

<p>He knew it would be folly to try to obtain this
information through the wily Frenchman, who,
wishing to add to their distress, would very
likely boast that the frontiersman had been
brought down.</p>

<p>Dick, however, quickly made up his mind that
this could not be the case. The sullen manner
of the three braves was enough in itself to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the story of their having been outwitted by
Mayhew. Then, besides, if they had slain the
hunter they would be shouting of victory and
holding up a freshly taken scalp in evidence.</p>

<p>“Depend on it, our friend got away,” Dick
told Roger.</p>

<p>“I was thinking that myself,” returned the
other, “for they look mad enough to bite a nail
in two, if they knew what such a thing was.”</p>

<p>For some little time they marched along
steadily. Then the important-looking Indian,
who was walking alongside Lascelles, turned,
and called out something in his own language.</p>

<p>“Good! we are going to stop at last!” muttered
Roger. “I can hear the tinkling of a running
brook close by. I hope the water is good
and cold, and that they let me drink my fill.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it, for the Indians
no longer kept pushing forward. To make a
camp, when far from home, was an easy matter
for these hardy braves, accustomed, as they
were, to enduring all manner of hardships with
the stoicism that has always distinguished their
race.</p>

<p>There were no tents to erect, no packs to undo,
and getting the meal was a most primitive operation,
since it would probably consist of cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
some sort of meat by thrusting it in the
flames at the end of long sticks of wood.</p>

<p>When some of the braves started to fasten the
prisoners to two trees that grew close together,
Dick thought it about time to begin making
friends. Accordingly he called to Lascelles to
approach, as he had a communication to make
that might strike him favorably.</p>

<p>“I have had some success in binding up gun-shot
wounds,” Dick told him, “and if I was
given a chance I believe I could do that poor
fellow some good. He may bleed to death unless
something is done.”</p>

<p>The wily Frenchman eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>“Zat sounds very good, but how am I to know
zat you vill not try to escape if ze bonds zey
are remove?” he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I will give you my promise not to attempt
anything of the sort as long as my hands are
free,” Dick assured him. “Besides, it would
be folly to try to run away when you have your
gun, and they their bows and arrows handy.
Come, loosen my hands and let me see what
I can do.”</p>

<p>Lascelles made sure to get the consent of the
chief before he would touch the thongs, but
he finally did so. Some of the Indians, learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that the paleface boy was a medicine man
among his people, watched with some interest
to see how he treated the wound of their companion.</p>

<p>Dick had in truth been unusually successful in
handling this particular form of injury, and
knew about how it should be treated. He had
scant material with which to work, but his deft
fingers made up in part for the want of other
things.</p>

<p>The salve which he produced from his ditty
bag was home-made, for his mother knew all
about medicinal herbs and their values.</p>

<p>When, after completing the job, Dick looked
up into the face of his “patient” and asked
how it felt, while the brave may not have understood
the exact words, at the same time he
must have guessed the nature of the inquiry,
for he nodded his head in the affirmative as
though to admit that his condition had been
made much more bearable.</p>

<p>“Now you <i>have</i> got a job on your hands!”
sang out Roger, as he saw the other wounded
warriors pressing forward, as though meaning
to have their hurts looked after in the same
fashion.</p>

<p>Dick was satisfied that this was not an effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thrown away. If he could make the Blackfeet
understand that white men were not the
unfeeling monsters they had been painted by
the French fur-traders it would be a good thing.
Besides, they knew not what their future might
be, and the time was likely to come when a
friend in the Indian camp would prove a profitable
investment. (<a id="Note_8r"></a><a href="#Note_8">Note 8</a>.)</p>

<p>“We ought to call this camp Armstrong Hospital,
I think!” said Roger, after it was all finished,
and Dick had been secured to his tree
near by.</p>

<p>“I hope my work wasn’t wholly wasted,” remarked
Dick. “As they have built a fire it
seems settled that we are to stay here to-night.
Perhaps to-morrow they mean to take us to the
other camp, where Lascelles said Williams is
held a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“And on my part,” added the other captive,
“I hope they will give us some of the meat
they’ve started to cook. When I can catch his
eye I want to ask Lascelles to get me a drink
of water. My tongue seems to be sticking to the
roof of my mouth.”</p>

<p>“If we could make one of the wounded Indians
understand, I think they would do a little
thing like that for us; but the Frenchman seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to be scowling blackly at me just now. Perhaps,
after all, he is sorry about letting me
dress the wounds of the braves; he may suspect
that I’m getting too popular, and that it
may somehow hurt his game in the end.”</p>

<p>“Who knows how that may work out?” declared
Roger. “One thing is sure, we must
keep our wits about us, and try to figure out a
way to get free.”</p>

<p>Dick seemed to be of the same mind, for he
nodded his head, and said:</p>

<p>“If we have half a chance we must try to
escape to-night. That Canadian scout in the explorers’
camp, Drewyer, knows considerable
about these Blackfoot Indians, and he told me
they are very treacherous, often killing their
captives as they take a freak, or the medicine
man of the tribe has a pretended message from
Manitou that they must be put to death. So we
dare not trust them, but must escape by any
means.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Apparently</span> it was not the design of Lascelles
to starve his prisoners, for later on he had them
untied, and gave them a chance to devour some
of the crudely cooked buffalo meat. They were
also permitted to drink their fill of the cold
water in the brook.</p>

<p>After all this had been done, with the trader
watching them constantly, and holding his gun
in readiness to frustrate any attempt at escape,
the boys were once more tied with long thongs
to the trees.</p>

<p>They noticed, however, that the brave who
fastened them was inclined to be much more
gentle with them than on the first occasion.
Dick believed the seed of kindness he had sown
was commencing to take root.</p>

<p>“It will be a night that we shall never forget,
Dick,” Roger remarked. “If it blows up windy
and cold, as it was when we were in the cave,
we will suffer terribly here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us hope then that we may not be here
all night long,” Dick ventured; and somehow
his manner, as well as his words, caused the
blood of his companion to leap in his veins.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” Roger asked. “Is
there a chance that we can break loose, tied up
as we are? Are you depending on Mayhew
to come to our rescue? Surely, you could not
have had any signal from him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied the other. “But have
you noticed where they put our guns and powder
horns?”</p>

<p>“I must say I hadn’t thought much about
that part of it,” confessed Roger; “but, since
you mention it, I think they are over against
that tree. The Indians are afraid of firearms,
you know. Perhaps the chief Lascelles spoke
to us about, and whom he called Black Otter,
hopes to force Williams into teaching him how
to use ‘the sticks that spit out fire and stinging
things.’”</p>

<p>“There is another thing that, perhaps, I ought
to tell you,” continued Dick, in a low tone. He
saw the Frenchman looking over at them just
then, as though wondering what they were finding
to talk about, and debating whether it might
not be safer to separate the pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it’s anything that will make me feel more
cheerful, I hope you will lose no time in doing
so,” Roger hastened to say.</p>

<p>“Please keep from showing so much in your
face then,” Dick told him; “or that man may
be able to read the whole story from where he
sits. Act as though we were without the first
ray of hope. He is a suspicious sort of man.
We must try to make him believe we mean to
make the best of it.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me, Dick; I am looking as if I’d lost
my last friend. What has happened? I am
sure you have made some discovery.”</p>

<p>“Oh! not so very great,” replied Dick; “only
that I believe I can get my hands free with very
little effort.”</p>

<p>“How does that happen?” wondered Roger;
“mine are as tight as they can well be. Did that
Indian favor you when he fastened us up the
last time; or was it through an accident?”</p>

<p>“Neither one nor the other, it happens,” said
the second prisoner, coolly. “I remembered to
swell up my wrists in a way I can do, when he
was putting the thongs around them. By reducing
them to the utmost, my hands are almost
free, and it will take but little effort for me to
free them entirely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“And then you can set me loose, too, though
I am afraid it will take you a long time to get
those knots undone. It must be an Indian way
of tying thongs, for I never saw its like before.”</p>

<p>“There is a better way than that,” Dick assured
him. “Don’t turn your head just now to
look, because Lascelles is watching us like a
hawk; but some time later on, when his back is
this way, cast your eyes to the right, and, sticking
in the tree not more than five feet away,
you will see my hunting knife!”</p>

<p>“Oh! how came it there?” demanded Roger,
watching the French trader, and ready to take
advantage of the fact if Lascelles should happen
to look away, even for a moment.</p>

<p>“I saw a brave give it a jab into the tree when
he was cutting some thongs from a strip of
buckskin before we were tied up; and ever since
I have watched to see if any one removed it.
So far, it has remained there.”</p>

<p>The Indians had by this time settled down to
take things as comfortably as conditions allowed.
The fire was sending out considerable
heat, and around the cheery blaze the red men
squatted, each with his gaudy-colored blanket
about his shoulders. Some of them were scantily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
clad for the wintry season, though doubtless
it did not occur to them in that light, as they had
become habituated to exposure.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at the picture presented.
They would, if they were fortunate enough to
live through the experience, often recall it in
future days, and, it was to be hoped, under happier
skies.</p>

<p>High the sparks soared from the fire, with the
red tongues of flame jumping up as though in
riotous sport. The bending tops of the neighboring
pines seemed to be whispering together
as though communicating the secrets of the wilderness.
It was all so strange and wonderful,
even after the remarkable sights they had looked
on of late, that Roger asked himself whether
it could be real, or only a dream.</p>

<p>Several of the Blackfeet had produced red
clay pipes and were smoking some weed that,
for all the boys could tell, may have been tobacco,
cured after their own tribal fashion.</p>

<p>“I only wish I could put something in that
stuff to make them sleep like logs until dawn,”
said Roger.</p>

<p>“They are beginning to show signs of getting
drowsy,” Dick assured him. “Already several
have curled up in their blankets, and seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
be fast asleep. Here comes the Frenchman to
take a last look at us before he follows them
into dreamland.”</p>

<p>“Oh! be careful that he may not learn of
the trick you played with your bonds!” Roger
whispered, in sudden alarm lest the crafty
trader make a discovery that would destroy the
hope they were hugging to their hearts.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, for I feel sure I can deceive
him, even if he tries my bonds to see how
secure they are,” Dick assured him.</p>

<p>Apparently Lascelles was very sleepy, for
he yawned several times as he felt of the thongs,
to see how they had been tied by the brave to
whom the task had been delegated.</p>

<p>“Eet is too bad zat you haf to stand all ze
night,” he told the boys; “but eet cannot be
helped. Eet is ze fortune of war. Ven boys
try to play ze part of men zey must take ze
good wif ze bad. In ze morning, unless ze
storm delay us, we vill hope to reach ze uzzer
camp, and then you see heem.”</p>

<p>He walked away after delivering himself of
these few remarks. The boys knew very well
who was meant by “heem,” for it could only
refer to Jasper Williams.</p>

<p>“That sounds as if he has Jasper, sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
enough,” remarked Roger, when they once more
were by themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we get away from here it must
be our duty to free him. We did it once before,
you remember; and what was next door to a
miracle then can happen again.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>When another half-hour had crept around,
conditions in the Indian camp had undergone a
decided change. There had been no sentry set
that the boys observed, and Dick had counted
the Indians many times to make sure that all
were around the fire. They lay sprawled in
such postures as their fancy dictated. Some
had their backs against the trunks of trees, while
others extended themselves at full length on the
ground.</p>

<p>One and all seemed to be sound asleep. Acting
upon the advice of Dick, both of the boys
had assumed an attitude calculated to deceive
any one who might be sending an occasional
glance in their direction, and make it appear as
though they, too, had yielded to the demands of
the slumber god.</p>

<p>“Is it time yet, Dick?” whispered Roger for
the third time, when it seemed as if his blood
had almost stopped circulating on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the tight bonds, and he doubted his ability to
use his legs, even if set free.</p>

<p>“Wait a little longer,” he was told, in the
same cautious tone, which, if heard at all, would
be considered but the murmur of the cool night
breeze in the nodding pine-tops.</p>

<p>The half-hour lengthened to a full one; and
even this was now growing, until it must soon
measure a second hour. Roger could not stand
it much longer. He felt as though something
within him would burst unless he could make a
move of some sort.</p>

<p>“Listen,” whispered Dick, just then, as if in
answer to the silent plea, “I saw something
move across on the other side of the camp. A
hand seemed to gently wave to me, and it was
not the hand of an Indian, either. I firmly believe
Mayhew, Heaven bless him, has come back,
taking his life in his hand, meaning to rescue
us from the Indians.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">That</span> is good news, Dick!” whispered
Roger.</p>

<p>“There, did you see him that time?” the
other asked, as cautiously as though he believed
every sleeping Indian possessed such keen hearing
that a very small sound would awaken him.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I believe it must be Mayhew. Are
you starting to work your hands free, Dick?
Oh! lose no time, I beg!”</p>

<p>“It is nearly done,” came in a breath from the
other; for all this time Dick had been working
his hands as cleverly as he could, considering
the fact that they had been tied behind him as he
stood against the tree.</p>

<p>A slight movement on his part a minute later
told the anxious Roger that he had finally succeeded
in accomplishing his task. His hands
were free, and wrestling with the knots in the
thongs that bound his body to the tree.</p>

<p>When Roger presently saw his companion
move, and then slowly sink down to the ground,
he held his breath, for he knew that, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
bonds were concerned, Dick was no longer a
prisoner.</p>

<p>His next move would be to reach after that
convenient knife, thrust into the tree close by.
Roger turned his eyes in the other direction.
His greatest fear now was that one of the sleeping
braves might wake up, and spoil all their
plans.</p>

<p>When he saw no sign of such a thing his heart
beat a little less tumultuously, and he breathed
freely once more. But it was a period of suspense
Roger would never forget.</p>

<p>Even the slight sound made by a passing
breeze struck a note of deadly fear in the heart
of the waiting lad; it seemed to be a crash of
thunder that would surely arouse the whole
camp. Yet no one so much as stirred.</p>

<p>Dick had obtained the knife, it seemed.
Roger could feel him at work. How it thrilled
him to know that those painful bonds were about
to fall away, leaving him free to stretch his
arms, and his lower limbs, so dreadfully
cramped during the hours that had passed since
they tied him there.</p>

<p>Dick, crouching behind the tree, had to work
in the dark, and mostly through instinct, his
sense of touch taking the place of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>He was succeeding, at any rate, which must
be reckoned the main thing. Roger knew when
the stout deerskin rope that kept him rigid
against the tree had been severed, for a hand
instantly steadied him, lest he fall over.</p>

<p>There now remained only the bonds about his
wrists, and they were apt to prove the most
troublesome of all. What if the steel blade did
give him several scratches and slight cuts? He
could stand almost anything while hope of liberty
swelled within him.</p>

<p>There, it was done at last! His hands fell
limply at his sides, numb and almost useless,
for they had been tied much tighter than in
Dick’s case.</p>

<p>The friendly hand plucked at his sleeve. Dick
meant this as a sign that they must be getting
away without loss of time, since every second
spent there meant additional risk of discovery.</p>

<p>It appeared a simple matter for Roger to copy
the example of his comrade and drop to the
ground, in order to crawl away; and yet, when
he came to do it, he found that his knees were
almost rigid, and could only be bent after a
violent effort.</p>

<p>Dick must have planned everything beforehand.
In times past he had shown himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
be a master hand at laying out plans to be pursued
in emergencies, and while tied to the tree,
observing all that went on in the Indian camp,
he surely had had plenty of opportunities to
note the conditions surrounding him.</p>

<p>At least he did not seem to be confused but
went about the task of leading his companion
to safety as though it were all a part of a schedule.</p>

<p>Dick had not quite understood the mute signals
which Mayhew had made when moving his
hand above the bushes; but it seemed as if he
meant to let them know he was about to make
his way to a point in their rear, where he might
find a better opportunity to assist them.</p>

<p>Dick hoped they would have the good fortune
to run across the guide. Three would be much
better than two, surrounded as they were by so
many perils.</p>

<p>When Roger became aware of the fact that
his pilot had stopped abruptly, he felt a cold
chill run over him, thinking it could only mean
that the discovery they feared was upon them.</p>

<p>Then he realized that Dick was softly laying
hands on some objects that had rested against
a tree-trunk. Like a flash it dawned on Roger
that they must be their guns, for he recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it was exactly in this quarter they had noted the
weapons.</p>

<p>What a wonderful fellow Dick was, apparently
capable of remembering everything, no
matter how minute the detail might be! Roger
breathed easy again. He even managed to put
out his hand and receive one of the guns from
his comrade, accompanied by a low hiss of warning.</p>

<p>Roger knew what was meant by this, and he
was very careful that his gun should not come
in violent contact with the tree-trunk or the
ground.</p>

<p>At that moment he chanced to look around,
and what was his horror on discovering that one
of the Indians had raised his head! He seemed
to be looking straight at the two boys, and, as
the flickering fire still gave a small amount of
light, he must surely have seen them.</p>

<p>Roger wanted to let Dick know, but his tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could
not make a sound. Dick was now moving off
again, creeping along more like a great cat than
a human being, so there was nothing left for
Roger to do but follow in his wake.</p>

<p>Every moment he expected to hear a yell of
alarm from the Indian who had been watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
their movements. As each second passed,
Roger was certain that the cry was bound to
break forth with the coming of the next.</p>

<p>His feet dragged like lead, because he believed
the attempt to escape was bound to be useless,
and that they could not possibly get away. He
counted the passage of time by the throbs of his
heart.</p>

<p>Once a twig flew up and struck Roger on the
knee. It was a blow as light as the falling of a
leaf, yet to the boy it seemed as though a heavy
hand had been suddenly laid upon him.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, nothing happened!
No yell rang out; nor was there an uprising of
those dusky forms that lay about the smoldering
fire. Foot by foot the ground was passed
over, and in a brief time they might hope to
gain the shelter of the friendly bushes back of
which Mayhew, it was hoped, would be found.</p>

<p>Still Roger dared not believe the escape would
be effected without an explosion of some sort.
He knew that the pioneers classed all Indians
with the cat tribe in regard to craftiness and
cruelty. How many times had he, as a small
lad, watched their pet cat catch a mouse, and then
play with the doomed animal, letting it go just
for the pleasure of pouncing on it afresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The conviction that pressed so heavily on his
heart now was that this brave was simply waiting
until the escaping prisoners had gained a
certain point, when he would give the cry that
would send the red inmates of the camp after
them in hot haste.</p>

<p>But now they were at the fringe of bushes,
and Dick had even commenced creeping around
one end of the break, afraid to enter lest they
cause a rustling that would imperil their safety.</p>

<p>Roger summoned all his nerve and looked
back. To his amazement he saw that the watchful
brave still had his head partly raised, and
was, to all appearances, looking after them.</p>

<p>It was a mystery in the boy’s mind that
ranked with those strange things they had continued
to discover ever since invading this Land
of Wonders. That the warrior saw them making
their escape, and still refrained from giving
the alarm, was a fact beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>Dick was moving faster now, though still taking
pains not to make any sound that could be
possibly avoided. Then Roger caught the low,
tremulous note of a bird, hardly more than a
chirp. Was that Mayhew trying to let them
know he was close by? Roger hoped so with
all his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>He could barely see Dick’s bulk just ahead
of him, and it was on it that he fastened his
gaze. If the pilot suddenly came to a pause,
Roger meant to be in a condition to instantly
follow suit.</p>

<p>Whispering caught his ear. Surely Dick was
not talking to himself, but must have come in
contact with the creeping guide. All seemed going
well, and, so far, there had been no alarm
from the camp.</p>

<p>A minute later he knew that Dick was no
longer on his hands and knees, but had gained
his feet. This meant that the time had come
when they might take more chances, and increase
the swiftness of their flight.</p>

<p>Roger noted, too, that there was another figure
ahead of his cousin, which he knew could be
no other than the guide, gallant Mayhew, who
had scorned to seek safety for himself while his
young friends were in peril.</p>

<p>Far away could be heard the dismal howling
of a wolf pack. An owl sent out a mournful
hoot from the depths of the pine woods on the
side of the mountain. But back there, where the
dying camp fire flickered, and the red men slumbered,
not a sound arose. Roger marveled
more than ever. He knew that his eyes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
not deceived him, and that the Indian had actually
watched them making their escape. But
what magic had rendered his tongue mute the
boy could not guess.</p>

<p>When half a mile had been placed between
them and the hostile camp Dick broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Do you think we are safe away, Mayhew?”
he asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” replied the figure plodding
ahead of the boys; “and I must say it beats
all how you managed to get free from those
deerskin thongs. There are other things that
puzzle me, too; but all that can keep until later.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am glad to hear you say you believe
we are well out of that fix!” exclaimed Roger,
who had looked back nervously over his shoulder
many times, and even shuddered at hearing
the slightest rustling sound, dreading lest the
tricky Indians might be creeping after them, and
suddenly awaken the echoes of the pine forest
with their war-whoops.</p>

<p>“It was one of the closest calls we ever had,”
admitted Dick.</p>

<p>“And we have known a good many of them,”
added Roger, with a slight return of his old
feeling of elation, for the reaction was beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to set in, so that from the depths of despair
he would soon find himself elevated to the
heights of exultation.</p>

<p>“One thing that none of us has thought to
notice so far,” commented Dick, “is that it has
at last commenced to snow as though it meant
business.” When he brought this fact to their
attention the others perceived that it was indeed
so, for already the ground had begun to turn
white.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>AN INDIAN’S GRATITUDE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time the three fugitives plodded
through the pine forest that lay along the side
of the mountain ridge, enclosing the wide valley
in which the camp of the Indians had been
pitched.</p>

<p>The snow was coming down in earnest now.
It acted as though bent on making up for lost
time; and, unless all signs failed, there would
be an exceedingly heavy fall before they saw
the sun again.</p>

<p>One comfort they found in this coming of the
white mantle—they could not be tracked by Lascelles
and his allies when their escape was discovered.</p>

<p>“Dick!” ventured Roger, after quite a long
time had elapsed, and they found the snow getting
constantly deeper underfoot.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“We have our guns, it is true, and that I
count a fine thing, but of what use are they to
us without our powder horns?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was our misfortune, Roger, but we
can borrow from Mayhew here. By being prudent
we ought to make his supply go around.”</p>

<p>Imagine the feelings of the two boys when
the guide gave utterance to an exclamation of
disgust and chagrin.</p>

<p>“I hate to tell you, lads,” he said, “but it
must have happened during my flight. I had
fired twice, and given the red hounds cause to
be sorry they chased after me; and then I suddenly
missed my powder horn. It must have
been torn loose while I was passing through
some dense bushes.”</p>

<p>“Did you go back and try to find it?” asked
Dick, while Roger seemed mute with consternation.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was no use,” replied the guide,
“and I had to give it up.”</p>

<p>“Then we are in a bad way, without any ammunition
for our guns,” Dick continued, though
he did not attempt to criticize Mayhew, for he
realized that, after all, it had been an accident,
liable to happen to any one, and he felt sure the
frontiersman must be suffering in his mind on
account of it.</p>

<p>“I have the load in my gun, and one in my
pistol,” said Mayhew. “Besides that I found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
little powder wrapped in a paper in one of my
pockets, enough to charge one of your guns, and
some left over for priming.”</p>

<p>“That was lucky, at any rate; how came you
to have it with you?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I remember that, some time before I left on
that trip back to the Missouri and down to the
outposts of civilization, I was cleaning out my
powder horn, and the little it contained I placed
in that paper, and then in my pocket. I forgot
all about it when I filled the horn from the
stores. Now, it may be, that one charge will
stand between us and starvation.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope it will never get as bad as that,
Mayhew,” said Dick; and yet, deep down in his
heart, he knew they were facing a desperate
condition, so far away from the rest of the expedition,
and surrounded by perils of every
type.</p>

<p>“Two charges in all!” summed up Roger,
finding his voice. “That means that we must
make each one tell. And, Dick, I want you to
load your gun with that spare powder Mayhew
has. You are a surer shot than I, and when we
use that load it must bring returns.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that later on,” was all Dick
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“But now that we can talk without running
any danger,” continued Roger, anxious to learn
whether either of the others had noticed the
same strange happening in the camp of Blackfeet,
“I want to ask you why that Indian, who
was watching us go away, failed to give the
alarm?”</p>

<p>Dick stopped short. He seemed to be astonished
beyond measure at what the other had
just said.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me, Roger, that you believe
any such thing?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” came the response. “I
looked back more times than I can tell you, and
there he was, craning his neck and watching
everything we did. To the very last I saw him
still looking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is right!” declared Mayhew, breaking
in upon the dialogue as though he, too, had
been grappling with a mystery that he could not
understand. “I saw the same thing. The Indian
was watching you, I could swear to that.
Once he dropped his head, only to raise it again.
He seemed to be having some difficulty about
holding himself up long, for he was bandaged
about the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The way Dick said that one word told Roger
that he must have seen a great light. But why
should Dick show signs of satisfaction; for that
was clearly expressed in his tone?</p>

<p>“You have guessed the answer, Dick?” exclaimed
Roger, hastily. “Please tell us what it
is, because, for one, I am groping in the dark.”</p>

<p>“You heard what Mayhew just said, and how
the man who looked was wounded in the shoulder?
Stop and think, and you will remember
that he must be the one who had chased after
Mayhew, and came back with a bullet wound in
the muscles of his shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Which you dressed as neatly as any doctor
could have done it,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“At the time the brave gave little sign that
he was grateful,” continued Dick, as he figured
things out; “but you know that all Indians practice
hiding their real feelings. They think it
weak to show signs of fear or anything like that.
But, at the same time, an Indian can be grateful,
and I believe that brave proved it.”</p>

<p>“He did, oh! he did!” exclaimed Roger, no
longer groping in darkness since Dick had
thrown light on the mystery. “He knew we
were escaping, but he could not find it in his
heart to betray the one who had been so kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to him! I shall never believe so badly of Indians
after this. My father was right when he
told me they could be reached by kindness; and
surely he and Uncle Bob ought to know.”</p>

<p>Somehow all of them fell silent for some time.
No doubt they were thinking how strangely they
had been favored by Providence. (<a id="Note_9r"></a><a href="#Note_9">Note 9</a>.)</p>

<p>Several hours had elapsed since the escape,
and they were some distance away from the
scene of the adventure. The snow was more
than ankle deep, and coming down at a furious
rate.</p>

<p>Walking was difficult, especially since all of
them were weary, and in great need of rest.
Roger staggered at times, and once fell flat,
though he hastened to assure the others, as
he scrambled to his feet, that he had not suffered
by his awkwardness.</p>

<p>“We will have to seek shelter of some sort,”
declared Dick, finally.</p>

<p>Apparently the frontiersman was only waiting
to hear something like this; for, as a grown
man, he did not fancy being the first to call quits,
as long as those boys saw fit to keep on tramping.</p>

<p>“It would not be a bad idea, I think,” he now
remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we could have a fire like we did that other
night it would feel good to me,” Roger told
them.</p>

<p>“We might try,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“And when morning comes, how about breakfast?”
continued Roger. “What meat I had
was taken away from me, and you must be in
the same fix.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they thought it was useless to let me
keep on carrying fresh elk meat when we all
needed something to eat. But I am thankful
they left me my ditty bag; and I have my knife
too, you remember. How about you, Mayhew?”</p>

<p>“I still have some meat with me; about
enough for one meal around,” replied the guide.
“After that is gone we will have to shoot game
of some sort, either elk or buffalo, so as to lay
in a stock.”</p>

<p>“Here is a place that looks as though it would
afford shelter from the storm among these fissures
in the rock,” announced Dick, which
declaration brought cheer to the heart of
Roger.</p>

<p>A little investigation, the best that conditions
allowed, showed them that they could enter one
of the fissures and avoid the sweep of the rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
wind that was now causing the snow to blow in
sheets.</p>

<p>Determined to do all in their power to obtain
some comfort, they selected the best shelter, and
then crept within. Roger was the first to discover
some scattered bits of wood lying around,
a tree that grew further up the abrupt face of
the mountain having dropped some of its
branches.</p>

<p>Accordingly they obtained a light by means of
the tinderbox and flint and steel. This enabled
them to collect some of the fuel, and in the end
they had a cheery fire.</p>

<p>Sitting near this for an hour made them so
sleepy that they were glad to roll over wherever
they chanced to be, and give themselves up to
slumber.</p>

<p>The snow continued to fall heavily during the
balance of the night. The wind howled through
the adjacent trees in a mournful fashion, but
within that fissure all was peaceful.</p>

<p>Once or twice the old frontiersman would
awaken on feeling cold, and toss more fuel on
the smoldering embers of the fire, after which
he would again lie down.</p>

<p>So morning found them. They would not
have known that the day had come if Dick had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
not made his way to the mouth of the fissure and
looked out. Apparently some hunter instinct
had warned him that sleeping time had passed.</p>

<p>The snow was falling as thickly as ever.
There was already a foot, and more, of it on
the ground. Up on the mountain, where a previous
fall had remained, it probably was twice
as deep.</p>

<p>To go out while the storm prevailed was
hardly wise, much as the boys wanted to be on
the move.</p>

<p>Dick had taken note of certain things while
the French trader was talking to them, and particularly
of the fact that, when Lascelles spoke
of the “other camp” in which Jasper Williams
was held a prisoner, he had, possibly unconsciously,
nodded toward the east.</p>

<p>It was in that direction the great lake lay of
which they had heard so much, and from
one thing and another Dick came to the conclusion
that the camp must be located on the
border of this large body of water.</p>

<p>Roger was looking anxiously at the meager
stock of meat which Mayhew had produced from
his pockets. There might be enough to satisfy
their present hunger, but, once it was gone, the
future did not seem very inviting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>They cooked it as on the former occasion.</p>

<p>“And it tastes much better than that the Indians
gave us,” Roger asserted, for the Blackfeet
took little pains to keep the meat from
scorching, and this had given it a taste not at
all pleasant to the boys.</p>

<p>All too soon was breakfast over, and the last
scrap of meat devoured. Roger heaved a sigh
of regret as he wiped his mouth on the back of
his hand.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew where we would get the next
bite,” he remarked. “It seems to me we eat
in queer places on this trip. But I wouldn’t
mind that so much if I only felt sure there
<i>would</i> be another meal.”</p>

<p>After that they sat around and talked as
they attended to the fire. Now and then one
of them would get up to make another hunt for
fuel, the stock of which was beginning to get
low.</p>

<p>It was far from a pleasant prospect staring
them in the face. The wonder was how Dick
could appear to be so cheerful through it all,
and keep on saying he felt certain it would all
come out right in the end.</p>

<p>Roger at least had the good sense to keep his
fears to himself. Whenever he felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
could almost give a shout, such was the nervous
tension under which he was laboring, he would
jump up and busy himself in hunting wood.
In action he managed to gain control over his
nerves, so that he could resume his seat, and
once more listen to what the others were debating.</p>

<p>Plans were gravely discussed. To hear Dick
laying these out one would never dream that
they were based upon such a slender shred of
hope. Two charges in their guns; many days’
journey from the home camp; surrounded by
mysterious workings of Nature calculated to
make most men flee in terror; sought after by a
revengeful French trader and his Indian allies;
and now overtaken by a snowstorm that promised
to make traveling additionally difficult—what
a prospect for two half-grown lads and a
single man to face!</p>

<p>The last time Dick came back from making
an investigation as to the conditions outside,
he brought a little satisfactory news. The snow
was falling in diminished volume, and there was
a promise that by another hour it might cease
entirely. Then they could issue forth, and begin
to beat their way toward that section of the
country where they believed the big lake to lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he imparted this information than
they were startled by a deep roaring noise from
without. It seemed as though the foundations
of the mountain were shaken and, remembering
what a strange country they were in, Roger
could hardly be blamed for starting up with a
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>The light that came in through the mouth of
the fissure suddenly gave way to darkness; only
the flickering gleam of their fire remaining to
show them which way to move.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has happened now?” asked Roger,
and as usual Dick seemed to know.</p>

<p>“It is a snow avalanche,” he told them, “and
I am afraid it has blocked our only means of
leaving here, so that we are once more prisoners!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE SNOW AVALANCHE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">A snow</span> avalanche!” echoed Roger. “Do
you mean it has come down from the side of
the mountain, and filled the opening we used
to get in here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” explained Dick, “that is what has happened,
as near as I can tell. But, after all, it
may not be so serious a thing. We will see what
can be done about breaking through.”</p>

<p>“We have to get out some way or other,
that’s sure!” declared Roger, as he hurried
along after his cousin, now heading for the place
where the exit had been.</p>

<p>This was now filled by a tightly-wedged mass
of snow. When they thrust the butts of their
guns against it they were amazed to discover
how firmly it had become packed.</p>

<p>“Why, it is like so much ice!” exclaimed
Roger.</p>

<p>“Almost,” added the more conservative Dick,
“though you can dig into it by working hard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
If we only had shovels here we might do something.”</p>

<p>“But how long ought it take us to burrow
through?” demanded Roger, with a note of dismay
in his voice.</p>

<p>“That depends on how thick the wedge turns
out to be,” replied Dick. “If it is five feet, we
could make it in an hour or so. If deeper
through than that, it would take us much
longer.”</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is we haven’t a scrap of
food along with us,” Roger complained. “If
we were well supplied in that way I’d think it of
less importance.”</p>

<p>“We must get out, one way or another,” continued
Dick, grimly, “and the first thing we
ought to learn is where the weakest part of the
blockade lies.”</p>

<p>“As it came down on the run,” Roger figured,
“it seems to me the greatest amount of snow
would gather at the base. How about that,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“You are right, and it will pay us to attack
the barrier as high up as we can get. There
may be some sticks of wood left back yonder,
which we can use to dig with. Let us take a
look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>A close search produced three fragments of
branches that could be utilized as makeshift
shovels; at least they would be able to dig after
a fashion into the hard barrier, and then collect
the loosened material by scooping it up in their
hands to be thrown away.</p>

<p>It promised to be slow and painful work, but
none of them dreamed of complaining. There
was so much at stake that even Roger had to
forget his natural feelings and devote himself
to vigorous work.</p>

<p>First of all Dick climbed up the best way he
could, and found out how they could secure a
footing in order to attack the snow blockade
higher up. When this had once been settled
they began.</p>

<p>Since all of them could not get at the small
space marked out, they tried it in relays. While
two dug the third one rested; and when one
of the others gave out he took the vacant
place.</p>

<p>The fire dwindled away and finally seemed
to go out entirely. They could spare no time
in order to search for more fuel; besides, while
devoting every energy to the task before them,
none of them felt at all cold.</p>

<p>“What are the prospects, Dick?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Roger, as he hastened to take the other’s place
in turn, having had a good rest.</p>

<p>“It strikes me the snow is packed lighter than
what we struck at first; what do you think about
it, Mayhew?”</p>

<p>The frontiersman was always willing to advance
an opinion after it had been asked, though
he would seldom speak first. So now he stopped
to take in a few good breaths, and then made
reply.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking the same way myself,
to tell you the truth. And it goes to show that
we must be getting near the outside, where the
pressure is much less.”</p>

<p>“Then we may break through at any time;
is that it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>After a short time Roger gave utterance to a
shout.</p>

<p>“I’m through the layer of packed snow!” he
exclaimed jubilantly. “See, here is a place
where a stick cuts into it as easy as it would
through a pear. We have won out, Dick; and in
a little while we ought to see the outside world
again.”</p>

<p>On investigation it was discovered that there
was good reason for Roger’s jubilation. They
had bored through the bank of snow that filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the opening, thanks to the wisdom shown in attacking
it at its weakest point.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards a hole had been made
sufficiently large to allow of their crawling
through it to freedom.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased falling, although there
did not seem to be a break in the clouds overhead.
It was much over a foot on the level, and
in some places, where the wind had drifted it,
they found it would pay them to go around
rather than wade directly through.</p>

<p>“That way leads to where we had our bitter
experience last night,” said Dick, as he pointed
toward the southwest. “We do not want to see
Lascelles and his red allies again, if we can help
it, so we will not turn in that direction.”</p>

<p>“If we ever do have to meet him face to face,”
added Roger, “let us hope it will be when we
have plenty of powder and bullets for our guns.
If the cowardly rascal had not kept himself hidden
behind that tree, while the fight was going
on, I would have made sure that my lead found
him. He is the worst enemy our families know,
for he would rob them of their homes.”</p>

<p>“I felt the same way,” confessed Dick; “but
he was too smart for us. I think he must have
guessed he would be the first target for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
guns. Still, we must remember that even Lascelles
is not as bad as he might be. He would
not allow the Indians to kill us on the spot, for
one thing, as some renegades would have done.”</p>

<p>“Well, after all,” Roger continued, “it is a
question in my mind whether he saved us because
he had a streak of decency in him, or for
some other reason. Perhaps he meant we
should be carried off by those Blackfeet to their
village, and adopted into the tribe.”</p>

<p>“It might be as you say,” admitted Dick,
“for he told us that was what he meant them
to do with Jasper Williams. It would be getting
well rid of troublesome enemies, because
there would be little chance of our ever coming
back.”</p>

<p>“Now that we have burrowed out of that trap,
what is the next move, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I think we have decided already that we
will not start back to the camp. Badly off as
we are, we have come a long way after Williams,
and, now that we know he is not a great many
miles away, we must find him!”</p>

<p>“If what that trader said is true Jasper needs
us, too,” declared Roger.</p>

<p>“If he is a prisoner we are bound to do all
we can to rescue him,” said the other boy, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
it required no little fortitude to be able
to decide in this way.</p>

<p>In one direction lay comfort and safety; in
the other direction they must expect to find
danger in many shapes, privations such as hunger
and exhaustion, and, for aught they knew,
death itself might lie in wait. Yet, in spite of
all this, neither Dick nor Roger hesitated.</p>

<p>“Then it is on with us to the Frenchmen’s
camp!” said Roger.</p>

<p>It was in that spirit they made their start.
Just how far away the mysterious sheet of water
lay they could not tell. It might be three miles,
it might be twenty, for all they knew. Vague
stories concerning it had drifted into the explorers’
camp from various sources. Trappers
who had caught a glimpse of it gave wonderful
accounts concerning its vast extent. Indians
recounted the most marvelous tales of its being
the home of the mighty Evil Spirit that possessed
the Enchanted Land.</p>

<p>The boys were not free from a certain amount
of superstitious awe; for human nature had not
progressed as far along certain lines a hundred
years ago as in these later days. But they possessed
bold hearts, and, animated by that single
purpose of serving those they loved, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
willing to dare anything rather than give up the
quest.</p>

<p>It was in this frame of mind, then, that they
began heading into the east, trudging uncomplainingly
through heaps of snow that often
came to their waists, and keeping a constant
lookout for either game or human enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>TRACKING A BUFFALO</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">They</span> are all snowed under, I fear, Dick!”
Roger thus remarked after they had been struggling
along for some time, without seeing a living
thing save some crows that flew over the
tree-tops, cawing at the three palefaces as
though scornfully demanding to know what they
were doing so far away from their kind.</p>

<p>“If you mean the small animals, such as rabbits,
foxes, mink and such,” Dick answered, “I
suppose it is so, though in time they must work
their way through the snow or die. But elk
can move around still. They are broad-chested
and able to bound over or break through the
drifts.”</p>

<p>“Then why have we failed to see a single elk,
or a lone buffalo?” asked Roger, as though he
took it as a personal grievance.</p>

<p>“I can only give a guess at the answer.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure it will be a good guess then,
Dick, for you seem to study the habits of everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
that moves, from a beaver building his
dam to the antelope we coax up within gun-shot
by waving a red piece of cloth. What do
you think is the reason all big game is lacking
about here?”</p>

<p>“The animals must know of some places, more
favored than others,” Dick explained, “where
the grass stays fairly green throughout the winter.
Snows may come and melt, and the cold
waves be tempered by hot springs every little
while.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish we could run across another of
those boiling springs before it gets dark, and
find a herd of elk hanging around it,” and Roger
undoubtedly meant every word he spoke.</p>

<p>As the day had been pretty well along when
they managed to break out of their snow prison
they could not hope, before night, to get any
great distance on the way to the big lake.</p>

<p>This being the case, it was really a matter of
greater importance to Dick and his two companions
that they succeed in their quest for food
than that they cover any considerable distance
before camping.</p>

<p>The prospect of another long night, without
a morsel of food to stay the pangs of hunger,
appalled them. Dick himself felt badly about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
although he managed, as usual, to hide his growing
disappointment better than Roger, partly
for the sake of cheering the other up.</p>

<p>“There is one thing none of us seem to have
noticed,” Dick observed, after another half hour
had crept by; “the clouds have broken, and we
may even see the sun before it sets.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly cheering news,” Roger returned;
“because if we had another fall of snow
on top of this, winter would set in ‘for keeps.’
And we did hope to be safe back in camp before
that.”</p>

<p>Before Dick could make any further remark
an exclamation from Mayhew drew the attention
of the two lads. The guide happened to be a little
ahead of them at the time, and was now seen
to be beckoning eagerly.</p>

<p>“He must have struck the trail of an elk at
last!” exclaimed Roger, showing all the signs
of the eager hunter.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” admitted his cousin, “because
he seems to be pointing down at his feet,
as though something he had discovered interested
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope it turns out that way, and that
if it is a trail it was not made by a file of reds,
or some of those ugly French trappers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>They were hurrying forward while exchanging
these remarks, and speedily reached Mayhew’s
side.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Roger, immediately.</p>

<p>“A fresh trail!” came the answer, and, looking
down, the boys could see for themselves
where some large animal had pushed through
the deep snow.</p>

<p>“An elk?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p>“No, a buffalo, I believe,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“One or the other, what do we care, so long as
we can bag him?” commented Roger. “So let
us be on the move. Every minute counts, with
the sun so low in the western sky, and night
coming on.”</p>

<p>There was indeed need of haste, for the short
afternoon would soon be gone and, unless they
had the good fortune to overtake the stray buffalo
within half an hour or so, all their hopes
would be dashed.</p>

<p>They immediately started forward; but the
depth of the snow in places retarded their progress,
and Roger often drew long breaths that
stood for impatience, for he dared not vent his
feelings aloud.</p>

<p>Dick, who was always observing little things,
discovered that the breeze favored them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
buffalo was heading up into the quarter whence
the wind came. This is the habit of most animals,
since it allows them an opportunity to
scent any lurking danger ahead, such as a panther
stretched on a limb and waiting to spring
upon them in passing.</p>

<p>Mayhew, who was a first-class tracker, every
now and then took a look at the trail as though
to decide what chance they had of overtaking
the struggling buffalo before night fell.</p>

<p>He made no comment, but Dick, who watched
his face, felt that the guide did not feel any too
sanguine. Evidently from certain signs, well
known to one of his broad experience, Mayhew
knew that they were still some distance in the
rear of the quarry and that, unless for some
reason the lone buffalo chose to stop while on his
way to a feeding ground, there was little likelihood
of their coming up with him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Dick was already making up his
mind to “grin and bear it,” as Uncle Sandy
was in the habit of saying when things could
not be changed, and he had to stand for whatever
came along.</p>

<p>Roger kept a bright lookout ahead. He hoped
to be the first to discover the huge animal outlined
against the white snow. Perhaps Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
had even figured in his mind just how they
would approach as near as they could, and then,
when their presence was discovered, and the
buffalo tried to escape, they would give chase.</p>

<p>If the animal was tired after floundering so
long through the deep drifts they would likely
soon be able to come up with him, when a single
shot might do the business. Roger did not forget
that their ammunition was low, and that it
would never do for them to be wasteful of powder
and ball.</p>

<p>The sun presently shone forth, but it was close
down to the top of the ridge far to the west, and
liable to dip out of sight at any time.</p>

<p>“The sun has set!” said Roger, presently, in
a tone of bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>“And we will have to give up soon, I fear,”
Dick told him; “because, while meat would be
a fine thing to have, we must first of all think
of passing the night without being frozen to
death.”</p>

<p>“It is going to be cold, that’s a fact,” admitted
Roger, trying to show that he could
grapple with the situation and not betray weakness.</p>

<p>Mayhew took a last look at the tracks, while
the boys awaited his decision with the deepest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
anxiety. When they saw the guide shake his
head in the negative they knew luck had gone
against them, and that this meant a supperless
camp.</p>

<p>“We have gained a heap on the critter,” Mayhew
declared, “but he was still going strong
when he passed here.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Nigh on half an hour, I should judge,” came
the answer.</p>

<p>“Then we must call quits, and devote all our
attention to finding a camp,” Dick determined.
“With a fire going we will not feel quite so badly
as in the cold.”</p>

<p>“Then we mean to keep up a blaze all night,
no matter what the risk?” demanded Roger.</p>

<p>“Of course we can try to hide the fire some,”
explained the guide; “but on a cold night like
this the reds are not apt to be moving, and the
risk will be slight.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the rest can stand it, I ought to, so
now let us begin in earnest to find a camping-ground,”
and Roger started looking to the right
and left as though he did not want to lose a
minute.</p>

<p>Indeed, at that season of the year in this far
northern clime, while the twilight might linger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for an hour or more, once the sun had set they
could not see well under the canopy of pines.
These, in places, had kept much of the snow
from reaching the ground, and there was a reasonable
hope that they could run across some
spot that offered shelter from the piercing night
wind.</p>

<p>Mayhew was so well versed in backwoods lore
that he could be depended on to locate such a
camp ground. If necessary they could build a
windbreak out of branches, and behind this make
their fire.</p>

<p>Before long the guide gave them to understand
that he had sighted what seemed to be an
admirable spot for passing the night.</p>

<p>“Over yonder you can see where I mean,” he
told them, pointing as he spoke; and even Roger
was forced to admit that it offered advantages
other places had lacked.</p>

<p>Mayhew took his hatchet and cut several slabs
from the bark of a tree. It was to be noticed
that he did this on the side nearest their intended
camp; but neither of the pioneer boys
asked why this was done, because their hunter
instinct told them Mayhew was only leaving his
mark so that in the morning they would lose no
time in picking up the trail of the lone buffalo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Once they arrived at the spot selected as their
next camp all started to work. Dick and Mayhew
began to erect a thick screen of brush on the
windward side, while Roger collected fuel wherever
he could find it.</p>

<p>When he had made quite a pile of broken
limbs, and splinters from a fallen pine tree,
Roger got out his tinder-box and flints, and
presently the rising smoke told that his fire
was a success.</p>

<p>As the night closed in around them it was
a rather cheery scene that Roger looked upon,
while engaged in gathering a further supply of
wood, perhaps twenty or thirty paces away.
His two companions were still engaged in adding
the finishing touches to the barricade; the
flames leaped up with a snap and a sparkle, and
the glow of the fire seemed to give the surrounding
snow a rosy tint that did much to take away
its cold look.</p>

<p>Roger sighed as he tightened his belt, drawing
it up another notch, a familiar habit with
hungry men.</p>

<p>“I think we will have to call this Camp Starvation,
Dick,” he remarked, as he threw down
the armful of fuel he had collected.</p>

<p>“No, that would hardly be a proper name for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
it,” the other told him immediately; “because
we haven’t reached that point yet. I mean to
put it down in my memory as Camp Hope!”</p>

<p>Roger must have been abashed by the gentle
reproach in Dick’s declaration, for he did not
make any reply until several minutes had
passed. Perhaps he may have been weighing in
his mind the many reasons they had to be thankful,
in spite of the dark clouds hanging over
their heads, for when he did speak up it was
to say:</p>

<p>“Yes, we will call it Camp Hope, Dick.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>FIRE FANCIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> they were taking some chances as
they sat there by their fire that evening; but
there was no help for it. Being without blankets
or any furs to keep them warm when sleep
overcame them, they dared not risk being frozen
as the cold became more intense with the passing
of the night.</p>

<p>Roger meant to show as cheery a face as he
could, but somehow he could not seem to think of
anything but the delights of eating. It is doubtless
so with all who have been deprived of their
customary food for an unusual time.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Dick,” he said, as he sat hugging
his knees and staring into the crackling
flames, “I was just thinking how, many a night,
when the wind would be whistling around the
corners of our cabin, Sister Mary and myself
used to sit and look into a roaring fire like this,
one on either side of the big hearth. I can picture
her sitting there to-night, with mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
father close by. And, Dick, perhaps they are
talking about us, wondering whether they will
ever see us again.”</p>

<p>Dick moved uneasily as he listened, for, to tell
the truth, his thoughts had also gone roaming
back to the dearly loved home, and in imagination
he was following the forms of his mother,
father and brother, as they moved to and fro in
the well-remembered living room.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Roger’s plaint took
another turn, induced no doubt by the feeling of
emptiness that caused him such uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it seems to me I can even catch the
fine odor of the stew that is cooking in the big
black pot swinging over the fire, with the lid
lifting to let out the clouds of steam. And oh!
Dick, how splendid it used to smell, too! What
wouldn’t I give to be sitting down with a plate
of it heaped up before me, some of mother’s tea
in a tin cup and a plate of her fried sweet-cakes
to top off with.”</p>

<p>Once Roger got started on that strain he
seemed to take especial delight in recollections
of about every feast in which he had ever indulged.
Dick let him talk on undisturbed.
How vividly he himself could recall all those
special occasions, when they had attended some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
country dance among the settlers’ young folks
at harvest home times. The faces of all the absent
friends came clearly before him and,
spurred on by Roger’s graphic descriptions, it
seemed almost possible to get a whiff of the
fresh bread being taken from the big old Dutch
oven in which, as a small child, Dick had so
often hidden from his companions when they
played games.</p>

<p>Roger prattled on as the hour grew late. It
seemed as though his recollections had no limit,
judging from the way in which he kept calling
up events of happy days.</p>

<p>But finally Dick began to notice that he faltered
now and then, and his eyes gave evidences
of approaching drowsiness. The warmth of the
fire was getting in its work and in the end
Roger stretched out, “just to rest his back a
bit,” as he explained to his companions. He
soon began to breathe regularly and Dick knew
that he slept.</p>

<p>For a time at least the hungry boy would forget
his gnawing pains, though possibly his
dreams would take on the joys of a feast, and
the awakening be all the more bitter in consequence.</p>

<p>“Poor Roger!” Dick said to himself, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
leaned over and gently drew the flap of the
sleeper’s tunic closer about his neck, “I wish
I had it in my power to provide a substantial
meal against your waking up; but where it is to
come from, unless it rains down from above, I
fail to see.”</p>

<p>It was just like the generous nature of Dick
Armstrong to forget his own condition in feeling
for another; Roger was as dear to him as his
own brother could be, since they had shared
each other’s joys and sorrows ever since they
were able to exchange confidences and fight
each other’s battles.</p>

<p>That long night would never be forgotten,
though they lived to an old age. Little sleep
visited Dick’s eyes. This came partly from his
sense of hunger, but also on account of the serious
condition that confronted them.</p>

<p>Their long quest seemed to have been wrecked
on the rocks, and that after success had appeared
to crown their efforts, which made it all the
harder to bear. Although Dick would not appear
downcast while Roger could see his face,
he had numerous doubts to wrestle with in the
silence of the night, and secretly groaned in
spirit many times.</p>

<p>During his wakeful hours he often caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
distant howling of a wolf pack. This coming of
the first deep snow of the winter would make
their task of securing daily food the more difficult,
and it seemed to the listener that there was
an additional mournfulness to those long-drawn
sounds.</p>

<p>Once he also caught the scream of some other
beast in the pine woods. Although it was not
repeated, Dick believed it must have come from
a panther seeking his prey amidst the snowy
aisles of the forest.</p>

<p>Mayhew, too, must have been wakeful, for several
times when Dick happened to be dozing he
arose and threw more wood on the fire.</p>

<p>When the stars told Dick morning was at hand
he felt as though a terrible load had been taken
from his mind. With ten hours of daylight before
them they must surely be able to obtain
meat and satisfy their craving for food.</p>

<p>While the other two were sitting cross-legged
by the fire, and talking in low tones, Roger suddenly
sat up. He stared hard at them, and dug
his knuckles into his eyes, as though he could not
believe what he saw.</p>

<p>Dick knew from the indications that he must
have been far away in his sleep, and that the disappointment
struck him cruelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“So, it was all a dream after all, and mother
was not calling me to get up or the griddle cakes
would be cold?” Roger remarked, dolefully.
“Oh, how fine they used to taste, with that wild
honey smeared over them! Do you remember
the time when we brought in four heaping
buckets of honey from that bee-tree up on Juniper
Creek, and how my left eye was closed by a
sting? But never was there such sweet stuff.
And to think that we have to go without a bite
of breakfast this cold morning!”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as it gets a little lighter,” said
Dick, “we will be on the move.”</p>

<p>“Searching for something to eat, you mean,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, whether it is that stray buffalo, or an
elk, we will not be very particular which,” the
other declared.</p>

<p>“Why, I think I could eat a—a wolf, almost,
I’m that caved in,” declared Roger, and no
doubt he meant it, too.</p>

<p>The dawn was at hand. Eagerly they
watched the pink flush spreading across the
eastern sky. With a change in the wind they
could hear a distinct muttering sound, and it was
easy to picture some gushing geyser in action,
perhaps miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as soon as they could see without trouble
they turned their backs on Camp Hope, and were
soon following the trail of the buffalo.</p>

<p>“If I thought we would have any trouble
about getting a supply of wood, so as to start a
fire in a hurry after we get our meat,” Roger
observed before they abandoned the camp, “I’d
be tempted to tote some of this good fuel on my
back.”</p>

<p>“No need of doing anything like that,” Dick
assured him. “If there is anything that is plentiful
around here it is fuel for a fire. I already
have some small bits of choice stuff laid away
for a time of need.”</p>

<p>The wind had shifted the surface of the dry
snow to some extent, so that in places they found
the tracks of the buffalo almost covered. But
Mayhew was a born trailer, and found no difficulty
in following the animal.</p>

<p>“You see,” he told the boys at one time, “this
may be a good thing for us, because we can tell
where the beast started fresh this morning.”</p>

<p>It was not twenty minutes after he made this
remark when the scout joyously showed them
where the buffalo had spent the night. They
could plainly see the imprint of his hairy coat
in the snow where he had lain down. The cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
had no particular terror for such a rugged beast
and, as he went on in about the same general
direction as his previous trail, they believed
they were right in assuming that the buffalo,
through instinct, knew where forage was to be
found, and was heading thither.</p>

<p>All possible haste was now made by the three
pursuers. It meant much to them that they
presently overtake the quarry, or else run upon
some other game.</p>

<p>Roger was already feeling weak from lack of
food. Only his will power enabled him to keep
alongside the others in that hot chase. He
strained his vision to the utmost, in the endeavor
to be the first to discover signs of the welcome
presence of the big animal with the shaggy
mane, which it seemed was their only hope of
staving off starvation.</p>

<p>When crows again flew overhead and continued
their scornful cawing, Roger several
times aimed his empty gun up at them, as
though he would have liked to give the impudent
birds of ill omen something to remember him
by.</p>

<p>“I really believe they must know we have so
little ammunition that nothing could tempt us
to waste a grain of powder on them this day,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he declared, angrily, when the clamor of crow
scolding grew worse.</p>

<p>“Oh! at another time you would hardly pay
any attention to them,” Dick told him. “Just
now all of us feel a bit nervous, and ugly. Let
them scold if it does them any good. We
haven’t yet reached the point where we could
eat crow, even if we felt like wasting a shot on
one.”</p>

<p>It was sensible advice, and, just as Dick prophesied,
the noisy flock was soon left in their
wake.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard some queer stories about crows,”
Mayhew remarked, “and how they even hold a
court to try some bird that has been bad. Once
I found a crow hanging by the neck dead in a
wild grape-vine. Of course I could never tell
if it got there by accident, or was hanged by its
mates; but lots of people I told the story to said
it looked mighty suspicious.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed a little at that, but went on:</p>

<p>“I’ve sat in the woods many a time, myself,
and watched a gathering of crows. It seemed
as though they came by squads from everywhere
until there were hundreds fluttering about the
trees. And such a terrible noise they kept up!
It made me think of school when we have spelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
bees, and everybody is trying to call out at
the same time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, trying to take some
interest in things that would cause him to forget
his misery for even a brief period of time, “and
then they would fly off in a great cloud, dodging
this way and that as though it might be an army
going to attack the fort of an enemy. Yes, they
are queer birds; but I don’t like them to make
fun of me when I’m sick for something to
eat.”</p>

<p>“They acted to me as if they were warning us
to go back!” suggested Mayhew, a little uneasily.
“I wonder why, and if there’s anything
up this way that would give us trouble.”</p>

<p>“It’s open country just here,” said Roger,
“and nothing terrible in sight. But I’d give a
heap if we could only overtake that loping buffalo.
You said a while ago, didn’t you, Mayhew,
that he could only be fifteen minutes or so
ahead of us?”</p>

<p>“That is what his tracks tell me,” the guide
assented, “and we are coming up on him all the
while. If we fail to see him in the next half
hour I will be a disappointed man.”</p>

<p>“Why, I must be getting weak on my pins,
for it seems as if the ground was trembling under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
me!” declared Roger, showing signs of sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>Dick and the guide exchanged hasty glances.
Apparently they were feeling something of a
similar nature, but could not lay it to the same
cause as Roger.</p>

<p>“It is getting much worse now,” cried Mayhew,
“and I can hear a terrible grumbling down
underneath me that I must say I don’t like over
much!”</p>

<p>All of them were by this time aroused to a
sense of their sudden peril; but it was Dick who
voiced the alarming truth.</p>

<p>“Run for your lives!” he shouted, “it must be
a boiling fountain about to burst, and we are
right on top of the crater!”</p>

</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>WITH HOPEFUL HEARTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Forgotten</span> at that minute were all their other
troubles, as each made hurried efforts to get
away from the spot. The trembling of the
rocks told plainly enough that some convulsion
of nature was about to take place; and Dick’s
words gave evidence that he himself had discovered
where the yawning crater of the boiling
spring lay amidst the half melted snow.</p>

<p>Hardly had they gone back some thirty or
forty feet when there burst forth a vast volume
of spray and steaming water that ascended high
into the air, reaching an altitude of possibly five
score feet before it lost its velocity, and began
to rain downward.</p>

<p>Immediately the snow around the entire vicinity
commenced to melt with the heat of the
falling water. With the sunlight falling on the
wonderful fountain the two boys thought they
had never in all their lives seen anything so sublime.</p>

<p>Mayhew was more alarmed than pleased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the spectacle. Its terror appealed more to his
backwoods nature than any beauty connected
with the display. Indeed, had he been there
alone, the chances were Mayhew would have
taken to his heels, not being desirous of such
close acquaintance with things he could not comprehend.</p>

<p>After staring at the magical fountain for a
brief time Roger once more allowed his other
nature to have sway.</p>

<p>“We are losing precious minutes, Dick!” he
called out, for the roar was so great that it was
impossible to be heard unless the voice were
elevated. “This may be all very fine, but it
doesn’t seem to satisfy the gnawing sensation
inside me.”</p>

<p>When Dick gave the word, Mayhew only too
gladly once more led off.</p>

<p>“That buffalo must have known of this hot
fountain, because he came straight up to where
it is,” Roger remarked, after they had left the
spouting geyser behind them.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it seems that it rises only at long intervals,”
Dick explained. “It may be that days
pass without an outburst. That accounts for
the snow around, which disappeared so fast once
the flow of hot water began.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger seemed content to accept this version
of the strange happening. In fact it was now a
past matter with him; his most urgent necessity
did not concern wonderful fountains at all, but
provender. He had a constant reminder with
him that “nature abhors a vacuum,” and that
an empty stomach gives its owner no peace.</p>

<p>“If we had stood where we were,” said Dick,
“the chances are some of us might have been
well cooked. My heart seemed to jump up in
my throat when you stumbled, Roger; but you
managed to recover your balance and come on.”</p>

<p>“I confess that I was a bit worried myself
about that time, Dick; but as a rule I’m not so
clumsy. Just now my legs seem weak and
wobbly. It must be that hunger is getting a
good grip on me.”</p>

<p>“All’s well that ends well, they say,” ventured
Mayhew, stealing a backward look over his
shoulder at the still spouting geyser that filled
him with such uneasiness.</p>

<p>“When the buffalo found this place all covered
with snow,” continued Roger, “so he could get
not a mouthful of grass or fodder, he started off
again in the same general direction. Where do
you reckon he is striking out for now, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose he knows of other places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
where he can feed, and is headed for one of
them,” was the answer Dick gave.</p>

<p>“There, the noise is dying down back of us,”
Mayhew announced. “It seems as though the
show is over for this time. Yes, the column of
hot water and steam is only half as high, and
getting less right along.”</p>

<p>“It may lie quiet for another spell, perhaps
days, before it breaks out again,” suggested
Dick, which remark proved that he was arriving
at some conclusion respecting these remarkable
geysers, in that he believed they all had regular
cycles for displaying their activities, some frequent,
others at much longer intervals, but all
working with clock-like fidelity.</p>

<p>Roger had already quite forgotten all about
the recent scare. Once more he was keeping his
eyes on the alert for signs of that lone buffalo
which would mean so much to them.</p>

<p>He had pictured the animal so many times
in his fancy that pretty soon the tortured boy
began “seeing things” that did not really exist.</p>

<p>“Look yonder, Dick,” he would say huskily,
“and tell me is that the old bull just alongside
that rock? Seems as though I can make out his
head as he stands there. Hadn’t we better
spread out, so as to surround him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>When Dick assured Roger that what he took
to be the head of the buffalo was only an outcropping
of the massive rock the other seemed
deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>“I was dead sure it must be our game, Dick,
indeed I was. But now I see you are right, and
it is a part of the rocky spur. How about that
brush heap ahead there; I may have been mistaken,
Dick, but I thought I could see something
moving. It is too low down to hide a big buffalo,
but Indians might be lying there, waiting to
knock us over. I hope they have some pemmican
along with them, for we could take it away,
you see, Dick; and even dry pemmican would
taste pretty good now.”</p>

<p>Dick began to feel a little worried about his
cousin. It seemed to him as though Roger was
getting light-headed on account of his privations.</p>

<p>“Oh! if only we could catch up with that miserable
buffalo bull,” Dick muttered to himself as
he tramped along. “Either that, or else run
across an elk. Something has got to happen
soon, or I’m afraid Roger will keel over, or
perhaps go out of his mind.”</p>

<p>The situation was getting more desperate.
Try as he would, Dick could discover no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in which it might be alleviated. They must
keep on constantly and hope that before long
they would come up with the animal they had
been tracking with the pertinacity of wolves.</p>

<p>He knew they were not making anything like
the progress they could have had to their credit
if they had partaken of their customary portion
of food. Weakness had seized upon them, and,
while the spirit was willing, the flesh seemed to
be lacking in the power to obey as promptly as
they would have liked.</p>

<p>Roger continued to discover suspicious objects
from time to time. Then his mood would
change, and he could be heard laughing softly to
himself, as though the whole thing was appearing
to him now in the guise of a great joke.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” muttered Dick, when one of
these spasms had passed off, leaving Roger more
morose than ever; “somehow he seems to feel
it so much more than either of us. I’ve got
to the last hole in my belt now, and I hope there
may be no need of my making a fresh one.”</p>

<p>When he looked toward Mayhew he saw that
the scout’s face had begun to show signs of renewed
eagerness. This gave Dick a thrill, as
hope once more commenced to flutter in his
breast. Certainly Mayhew would not look like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that unless he had good reason to believe they
were now close upon the heels of the roving
buffalo.</p>

<p>Then Mayhew raised a warning finger; at the
same time he nodded his head toward the muttering
Roger. Dick comprehended the action;
it meant that some means should be taken to
keep the other quiet, lest he warn their quarry
of their coming long before there was any necessity
of such a happening, and thus endanger the
success of their stalking game.</p>

<p>Accordingly Dick hastened to get alongside
his cousin. He laid a hand on Roger’s arm, and
the other, raising his head, turned a pair of red
eyes upon Dick.</p>

<p>“Keep still, Roger!” hissed Dick, holding up
a finger. “Mayhew says we are right on the
heels of the game. You must not speak a single
word above a whisper, or all may be ruined. Do
you understand what I am saying?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, Dick,” began the other, cautiously,
as though aroused by the joyous news,
and coming back to his senses again. “I hope
you are not thinking me silly just because I’ve
been complaining of feeling hungry?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, now, it’s going to be all right,”
said Dick, soothingly, for he was afraid Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
might want to argue the matter with him. “As
you have an empty gun you must let us do the
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear about me, I understand!”</p>

<p>“Well, keep still now, Roger. Not another
word, but hold yourself ready to start that fire
soon. If you listen hard you may hear the horn
blow for dinner like it does at home when we are
out in the field. Silence now, Mayhew must
think he sees our game.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the actions of the guide would give
any one to understand something like that. He
was moving along with his body bent over, and
gripping his faithful rifle in both hands. Although
both of the boys used their eyes to the
best advantage they could not see anything to
hearten them; but then the strain on their
nerves, because of all that blinding snow, may
have had something to do with this failure.</p>

<p>Mayhew turned quickly toward them. He
said not a word, but his lips moved, and he
nodded his head in a manner that thrilled the
boys.</p>

<p>It had long ago been decided just what their
tactics should be in case they were so fortunate
as to come up with the quarry. Neither of them
meant to fire until they had managed to get so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
close to the game that one shot alone would be
necessary to bring the animal down.</p>

<p>Of course, when their presence was discovered,
the buffalo would start off at as brisk a
pace as possible, in order to escape from his
human enemies. They believed, however, the
animal must be nearly tired out from breasting
the deep drifts so long, and that its burst of
speed could not last any great while.</p>

<p>If it became absolutely necessary, they were
prepared to risk everything on a long-distance
shot, and the hope of wounding the animal.
This would hasten its halting at least, when it
could be dispatched at their pleasure, even
though they used knife and hatchet to accomplish
this.</p>

<p>Roger must have been greatly impressed with
what Dick had said to him, for he remained perfectly
still after that, at least so far as giving
voice to his feelings was concerned.</p>

<p>Dick had pushed on ahead of his cousin, as he
had announced he intended to do on account of
holding one of the loaded guns. Side by side
with Mayhew he now advanced along the fresh
trail. Even a novice could see that some animal
must have passed only a few minutes before, for
there were places where snow actually fell over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
into the tracks, as though it had been balanced
on the edge of the depression.</p>

<p>The anxious waiting that almost made them
sick at heart ended at last. Dick caught a
scuffling sound that came from beyond the next
line of bushes. Something was moving there,
and he could easily imagine that the hungry buffalo,
scenting some sort of grass under the snow,
might be trying to get down to it.</p>

<p>Bending lower still, they pushed on, with eyes
glued on the spot where those significant sounds
came from. In another minute they would be
able to look over the tops of the bushes and see
what lay beyond. Then, if all was well, a lucky
shot would procure them the meat of which they
were in such desperate need.</p>

<p>No one made a sound so far as Dick could
tell, so it could not have been that which gave
warning to the suspicious buffalo. Perhaps a
shift in the wind carried some taint of their
presence to his sensitive nostrils and aroused
his fears.</p>

<p>However that might be, Dick heard a sudden
snort, and then there came a shout of dismay
from Roger, who, standing more erect than the
rest, must have been able to see what was going
on beyond the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s on the run, Dick! Oh! hurry, and
shoot, or he will get away from us!”</p>

<p>As Dick and Mayhew cleared the bushes with
great bounds they saw the buffalo plunging into
a deep drift and scattering the snow in every
direction. But what thrilled the two hunters
was the fact that, in dashing headlong into the
drift, the beast had entered a trap from which
escape would not be easy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>THE HUNTERS’ FEAST</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Head</span> him off!” Roger called from the rear,
while he made all haste to come up, even though
he had an empty and useless gun, and could not
be of any assistance to his comrades.</p>

<p>The others had gauged the situation, and realized
that their best move was to follow directly
after the animal, thus causing him to push
deeper into the trap. The heavy fall of snow,
that they had grumbled at so many times when
struggling along knee-deep, now promised to be
their best ally.</p>

<p>In this fashion they presently found themselves
close upon the struggling bull. Floundering
there he could not make much headway,
and at last in desperation the animal started to
turn upon his pursuers.</p>

<p>They knew well what the result might be if
they allowed the charge to be carried out. One
of them would be struck down by those wicked
black horns that adorned the shaggy head; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
worst of all, the animal was likely to escape,
since Roger could do little or nothing to stay his
flight over the back trail.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i317.jpg" width="316" height="500" alt="shooting at buffalo in snow" />
<div class="caption">“THE BUFFALO WAS JUST IN THE ACT OF TURNING WHEN THE FRONTIERSMAN FIRED”</div>
</div>

<p>It had been arranged that Mayhew was to take
the first shot, and they hoped one would be sufficient,
with the backing of knife and hatchet.
The buffalo was just in the act of turning when
the frontiersman fired, and in consequence Mayhew
could hardly have asked for a better showing,
since one flank was wholly exposed.</p>

<p>At the time the marksman could not have been
more than fifteen feet away, and a miss was
out of the question. Mayhew had hunted these
huge bison on numerous occasions, since he was
one of those upon whom the exploring party depended
for a regular supply of fresh meat.</p>

<p>This being the case, he knew exactly where to
place his bullet in order to get the best results.
As a consequence no sooner had he discharged
his gun, and drawn his hatchet in order to be
prepared for the worst, than he saw the animal
stagger and fall in his tracks.</p>

<p>A vital spot must have been reached by the
missile that was driven by that heavy charge of
powder; for the long-barreled guns of the pioneers
were powerful in their execution.</p>

<p>When Roger saw the quarry struggling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
snow-drift his excitement became so great that
he could not even shout, much as he felt like so
doing. Hurrying toward the spot, he fastened
his hungry eyes upon the animal whose efforts to
rise were becoming more and more feeble.</p>

<p>Presently Mayhew, watching his chance,
stepped briskly forward and with one well-aimed
blow from the back of his hatchet finished the
business.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” gasped Roger, carried away by
the importance of their well-earned victory.</p>

<p>No doubt delightful visions immediately began
to flit through his brain, as in imagination he
saw himself seated by a fire, and devouring ration
upon ration of savory buffalo meat.</p>

<p>“Remember your part of the transaction,
Roger!” warned Dick, as, knife in hand, he
prepared to cut up the game.</p>

<p>“That means a fire!” answered the other, excitedly.
“Hand me over the fine stuff you said
you had packed up, Dick. Oh! you can depend
on me to get things going in a hurry. There’s
a spot close by where I saw plenty of wood.
The snow was blown away somehow or other.
Give me a little time, and you will see smoke
rising!”</p>

<p>Doubtless Roger had started scores, even hundreds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of fires in his time; but it is certain that
he never entered into the task with a lighter
heart than on this particular occasion. His very
soul seemed to be singing with joy as he hastily
gathered up some of the wood most easily obtained,
and then, picking a good spot, proceeded
to use flint and steel with hopes of speedy results.</p>

<p>Finding that his very eagerness was delaying
him, Roger called a halt, took himself to task,
and after that settled down grimly to accomplishing
his part of the proceedings without a
hitch.</p>

<p>In a short time smoke began to curl upwards
from his small beginning. Blowing the feeble
blaze he quickly had it taking hold in earnest.
The crackle and snap of the burning wood was
music to the ears of the almost delirious
boy.</p>

<p>“The fire is ready, Dick!” he called out.</p>

<p>“Then come for some of the meat, and commence
business,” was the welcome answer.</p>

<p>As there was nothing that Mayhew could do to
assist in carving the dead buffalo, he also was
given various “hunks” of the meat, and presently
the two sat there by the fire, attending
to a dozen or more sticks, on the ends of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
their long-delayed meal was being slowly
browned.</p>

<p>Never in all his life had Roger felt so frantic
upon smelling the odor of cooking meat. It
would have been just the same had their fare
consisted of venison, bear meat, or wild turkey;
all he wanted was something to satisfy that
terrible craving which was overpowering
him.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Roger, unable to
stand the suspense and temptation longer,
snatched the first piece from its stick before it
was half-cooked, and commenced to devour it
like a savage.</p>

<p>He seemed to enjoy it, too, which fact caused
the guide to speedily follow his example and appropriate
one of the sections for himself.</p>

<p>Dick, coming up just then with a further supply,
first of all filled the empty sticks with fresh
portions, and then—well, Dick was just as hungry
as either of his comrades, and there was
really no sense in waiting any longer, so he made
it unanimous!</p>

<p>After they had taken the sharp edge off their
ravenous hunger the pace was not quite so swift.
They were willing to wait until the meat was
fairly well cooked; and by degrees it was noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that they even began to slacken in their attack.</p>

<p>At length Dick laughed as he remarked:</p>

<p>“I think I have reached my limit, and, as I
hardly want to be called a glutton, I mean to
quit.”</p>

<p>“One more piece will satisfy me—for a while
at least,” Roger confessed.</p>

<p>The guide also admitted that he believed he
could contain no more. Although possibly at
another time Roger might have complained
about the fresh meat being tough, no one heard
him utter a single word against it on that occasion.
It would be adding insult to injury to find
fault with something that had really been the
means of saving their lives.</p>

<p>“While we have this fire,” suggested Dick,
“it would be a good idea to cook some more of
the meat. We may not be able to start another
blaze later on; the danger of being discovered
and attacked might be too great. What do you
think about it, Mayhew?”</p>

<p>“It is a sensible idea, I must say,” came the
immediate reply.</p>

<p>As that settled it, Dick went over and proceeded
to do some more work with his keen-edged
blade. They meant to take considerable
of the meat along with them at any rate; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
much had been decided on long before. With
but another shot left between starvation and
themselves, they could not afford to be wasteful
when good luck had thrown a chance like this in
their way.</p>

<p>Roger was quite a different sort of fellow,
now that he no longer experienced the tortures
of an unappeased appetite. He could even look
hopefully into the future, and see glorious opportunities
for carrying out their plan of campaign.
As Dick had truly said, what they had
done once could be accomplished again. Favored
by the protecting hand of Providence,
they must surely be able to get the better of
that cruel and scheming French trader.</p>

<p>The big lake where the river had its source
could not be many miles away from where they
now stood. They would push steadily on, and,
upon striking its shores, ascertain where the
Frenchmen had their camp.</p>

<p>“They must have a fire in such cold weather,”
Roger argued, and the others agreed with him,
glad to find that he was looking at matters so
cheerfully. “And fire makes some kind of
smoke, so we ought to be able to tell where it is.
Then, when the night comes, we can creep up
and set Jasper free.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>How simple the program seemed now! The
rocks heretofore appearing almost unsurmountable
diminished in size, and no longer stood as a
barrier that could not be scaled. A full stomach
nearly always makes one see things in a rosy
light.</p>

<p>Finally it was decided they had cooked a sufficient
supply of meat. The balance that they
expected to carry with them was made up in
small packages enclosed in portions of the buffalo
hide and tied securely with thongs.</p>

<p>As they were burdened with little save their
guns, now almost useless to them, these packages
would not prove troublesome. Roger was
willing to load himself down with twice the
amount, and bravely stagger under it all, rather
than risk the chance of suffering again the misery
he had endured.</p>

<p>“You feel sure the lake lies to the east of us,
Mayhew, do you not?” Roger asked the guide
when they were ready to start, feeling ever so
much stronger, and able to push through the
drifts where they could not be skirted.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything points that way,” he was
assured by Mayhew. “From the way that
Frenchman pointed when he was talking to you
both, Dick figured that the lake was off in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
direction. And then the crows fly that way in
the morning, and return again in the evening.
That is a pretty good sign, I take it.”</p>

<p>Roger became interested at once. Here was
something he had not thought of noticing, and
consequently he wished for more information.</p>

<p>“Tell me why that should be so,” he asked,
as they started.</p>

<p>“These crows do not drift south in the winter
time,” explained the frontiersman. “They
stay up here, and, as they must find feed when
the earth is covered under many feet of snow,
they have learned that along the shore of the big
lake they can get what they need—dead fish and
all sorts of other things cast up by the waves.”</p>

<p>“But what if the lake freezes over, as it may
do in very hard winters?” Roger questioned.</p>

<p>“Oh, they would still find things to eat on the
ice,” returned Mayhew. “Being an open
stretch, the wind would keep the snow from settling
there. But no matter, that is where they
fly each morning; and you know what hunters
say about a direct line being as ‘straight as the
crow flies.’”</p>

<p>“Mayhew is right, Roger,” said Dick, “and
the chances are as ten to one that we are heading
straight for the big lake right now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time they made steady progress.
Possibly they covered as much as two miles when
the guide was suddenly observed to come to a
full stop. Both of the boys followed suit.
They were not ten feet behind Mayhew, so it was
possible for them to exchange words with him in
low tones. Dick it was who found his voice first,
for Roger grew so excited he became dumb for
the time being.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mayhew?” asked Dick, half-elevating
his gun, which contained the only charge
of powder and lead they possessed, and under
such conditions might be looked on as their sole
means of defense in case of threatening peril.</p>

<p>“There are Injuns near by,” came the answer.
“I saw a feathered head rise above yonder bush;
and, as I live, there are others on either side of
us. It looks as though we were surrounded!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>ALLIES WITH COPPER-COLORED SKINS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mayhew made that dire announcement
it sent a foreboding of coming trouble straight
to the hearts of his young companions.</p>

<p>If the wily red men had succeeded in surrounding
them, so that there was no chance of
escape, they might as well give up all hope of
saving themselves from capture. Poor Roger,
who had so recently been brimming over with
confidence concerning the ultimate success of
their expedition to the camp of the Frenchmen,
now found himself sinking once more into a pit
of despair.</p>

<p>“What had we better do, Mayhew?” asked
Dick, grimly.</p>

<p>“That is for you to decide,” replied the scout.
“Each one will have to follow his own bent. As
for myself, I know well that capture would mean
death at the stake for me. So I shall fight to the
last gasp, and, if the chance comes, try to make
my escape as I did before. A man can die but
once, and better in battle than by fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick hardly knew what to say or do. He had
a charge in his gun, it is true, and with ordinary
luck that might account for a single Indian;
but would it be the part of wisdom to enrage
the savages by this rash act?</p>

<p>He turned to the right and to the left. Yes,
even as Mayhew had said, there were enemies
concealed everywhere, for he could see feathered
heads rising from behind various sheltering
bushes.</p>

<p>Flight seemed impossible, and, while the
thought of surrender chilled his blood, it began
to look as though there might be no other course.</p>

<p>Then all at once Roger heard his cousin give
a low cry. It was not alarm that rang in that
utterance, but rather sudden surprise, even
hope. Roger could not guess what it meant,
but turning toward his comrade, he seized hold
of his arm and stared in the other’s face.</p>

<p>To his amazement Roger saw what looked
like an expanding smile beginning to appear
there. He feared Dick must be going out of
his mind when he could show signs of pleasure
upon facing such a terrible condition as that by
which they were now confronted.</p>

<p>“Mayhew, look again!” cried Dick. “Pay closer
attention to the feathers in their scalp-locks!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Tell me if they are not different from
the feathers the Blackfeet wear!”</p>

<p>It was the frontiersman now who uttered a
cry.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right, boy! These are
not Blackfoot braves!”</p>

<p>“They are Sioux warriors, and, it may be,
fresh from the village of our friend, the chief,
Running Elk!” said Dick.</p>

<p>Roger found his voice at hearing that glorious
news.</p>

<p>“Try them, Dick!” he exclaimed, excitedly.
“Give them the sign the chief taught us! Let
them know we are friends, and not enemies!
Yes, I can tell the feathers are those of our
friends, the Sioux. It is going to be all right
after all!”</p>

<p>Dick meanwhile took out a piece of white
linen he had with him and started to wave it.</p>

<p>At the same time he made certain gesticulations
with his other hand that would have a
meaning in the eyes of Sioux braves, if, as they
hoped, these hidden red men proved to be
such.</p>

<p>At first no notice was taken of his signals.
Perhaps the wily warriors suspected that it
might be some sort of trap to catch them unawares;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
but, as Dick continued his motions, they
presently met with a response.</p>

<p>Several Indians cautiously arose to their feet,
making responsive gestures. Then they started
to advance toward the spot where the three palefaces
stood.</p>

<p>“Why,” exploded Roger, “look at every bush
giving up a brave! There must be twenty of
them, all told. How lucky for us they are Sioux,
and not Blackfeet, the allies of Lascelles.”</p>

<p>From every quarter the Indians now advanced,
forming a complete cordon around Dick
and his friends, who awaited their coming
calmly, confident as to the result of the meeting.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Roger, “I am sure I know that
man in the lead, with the feathers of a chief in
his long black hair, and the bears’ claws around
his neck.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other remarked, “I was just going
to say the same thing. He is a sub-chief by
the name of Beaver Tail. Surely he should remember
us, and what we did to make his chief
our friend.”</p>

<p>“Will he remember us, do you think?” continued
Roger, apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” Dick assured him; “all will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
be well. An Indian, once a friend, can be depended
on forever. I am only too glad now I
held my fire.”</p>

<p>As the first of the Indians came up, the boys
waited anxiously to see whether they would be
recognized by the sub-chief. To their satisfaction
Beaver Tail immediately greeted them as
friends, after the manner of his tribe.</p>

<p>Others of the warriors must also have discovered
that they had seen two of the palefaces
among the lodges in their home village, for there
were numerous grunts and friendly nods among
them.</p>

<p>“How can we let Beaver Tail know what we
are here for, and beg him to help us save Williams
from the Frenchmen?” Dick now asked.
“The chances are that not one of the braves or
the chief himself can speak a word of English.
Shall we make signs in the snow, and tell him
that way?”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me, lad,” Mayhew told him. “I
have a little smattering of the Sioux tongue,
for once upon a time I was a prisoner among
their wigwams for months. With the aid of
signs I shall be able to tell him the story of how
we seek Williams, the man who was in your
company at the time their chief set you free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
And they will, I feel sure, help us carry out
our plan.”</p>

<p>Both the pioneer boys watched Mayhew with
intense eagerness as he faced Beaver Tail and
commenced to speak to him in his own language.
The chief looked astonished and pleased as well,
for he had never dreamed that a paleface could
talk in the Dacotah tongue. (<a id="Note_10r"></a><a href="#Note_10">Note 10</a>.)</p>

<p>While Mayhew was talking Dick watched the
face of Beaver Tail. He could see that by degrees
the chief was catching the drift of what
the guide tried to explain. Of course this
consisted in the main of their desire to overtake
Williams, who had set off on a hunting trip, and
more to the effect of how he had been unlucky
enough to fall into the hands of the Blackfeet,
who were acting in conjunction with certain
French traders.</p>

<p>It was a clever idea on the part of the guide
to bring in the Blackfeet, because, as he very
well knew, there was never-ending war between
that tribe and the Sioux. This would make
Beaver Tail all the more willing, even eager, to
lend his aid in effecting the rescue of Williams.</p>

<p>Step by step Mayhew advanced. When his
limited stock of words failed him, the guide resorted
to crude drawings on the snow, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
device he seemed to be quite adept, if the boys
could judge from the chorus of “how-how” that
broke from the crowd of braves after each effort
in this line, and which they judged meant appreciation
on the part of the interested onlookers.</p>

<p>Finally the guide had reached the conclusion.
He must have asked Beaver Tail to help the
paleface friends of the great chief, Running
Elk, to rescue their companion from the hated
enemy, because the Indian was nodding his
head as though the proposition struck him favorably.</p>

<p>Then he commenced talking in return. When
he saw from the puzzled expression on the face
of Mayhew that the frontiersman failed to catch
the idea he was trying to express, the chief
turned to the sign language, upon which his race
have always relied when communicating with
each other, or to commemorate great events
such as glorious victories.</p>

<p>“What does he say, Mayhew?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“He knows where the Frenchmen have their
camp, and it is, as we believed, over on the big
water,” replied the guide.</p>

<p>“Good! And will he take us there, and help
us rescue Jasper?” continued Roger.</p>

<p>“He says he will,” Mayhew announced, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
a happy smile on his weatherbeaten face, for
things had taken a decided turn in their favor,
and he began to imagine himself back in the
main camp, ready to make another attempt at
taking that message down to the mouth of the
Missouri River.</p>

<p>“When?” continued the impatient Roger.</p>

<p>“We can be heading over that way as soon as
we feel like it,” the guide explained. “The
lake is about seven miles from here, as near as
I can make him out from his sign drawing.
Once we get close by we must wait for night to
come. It is against Injun nature to ever make
an attack in broad daylight, when it can be
avoided.”</p>

<p>“So long as they do not injure Jasper it will
not matter much,” Roger admitted.</p>

<p>“If they have not hurt him up to now I do
not think anything is going to happen before
night comes around,” Dick told him.</p>

<p>As there was nothing more to be arranged
Mayhew managed to tell the chief that they
gladly accepted his offer of assistance, and
placed themselves wholly in his hands. Perhaps
the artful frontiersman, knowing the nature of
all Indians, managed to convey more or less
flattery in his speech. At any rate Beaver Tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
gave evidences of being greatly pleased by it,
and even went around shaking hands with the
three palefaces, in the same way he had seen
the head chief, Running Elk, do on a former
occasion.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing for the exploring expedition
that members of their party had been
able to make friends with this tribe of the
powerful Sioux nation so early in their invasion
of the hunting grounds of these Western Indians.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger had shot a savage panther
that was about to leap from the limb of a tree
upon an old Indian squaw and a little girl.
Later on, when the boys found themselves prisoners
of the Sioux, this squaw, who turned out
to be a sister of the great chief, Running Elk,
and the child Dove Eye his own daughter, saved
their lives; and from that time on the Sioux, at
least that particular tribe, were on friendly
terms with the explorers.</p>

<p>Accompanied by that host of fighting warriors,
Dick and his party pushed on into the east
for several hours, not trying to make any fast
time, however, since they were in no particular
hurry to arrive before evening.</p>

<p>“If you have been taking notice of the fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Dick,” Mayhew remarked, as he drew alongside
the others, “we have our backs full on the westering
sun.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dick returned, “I did take note of
that, and it tells us you were right; the lake,
and the camp of the Frenchmen as well, lie
straight to the east.”</p>

<p>“Look up, Roger; what do you see?” demanded
the guide.</p>

<p>“Our old friends, the crows, flying in flocks,
all in a straight line, and heading into the sun.
Listen to them cawing; but somehow or other
the sound doesn’t ‘rile’ me as it did before. In
fact, I rather like to hear it, because I can fancy
they are saying: ‘You are on the right track,
the camp is only a little way ahead, and good
luck to you!’”</p>

<p>Dick laughed softly.</p>

<p>“That is only because you are happy now,
while before you had a heavy load on your mind.
As none of us can understand crow talk we must
let it go by. See how they rise in the air when
they glimpse us. Wary old rascals that they
are, they scent danger a mile off.”</p>

<p>“And, as we must be getting near the big
water now,” interposed Mayhew, “it may be
just as well that we forego talking except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
whispers. There can be no telling about those
crafty Blackfeet; some of them may be roving
around, on the lookout for meat, and spy us.
Leave it all to the chief, and let us copy everything
they do, so as to show Beaver Tail we
have handed the whole job over to him.”</p>

<p>After that not a word passed between the
three comrades above their breath, as they
moved along in company with the dusky crew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>THE CAMP ON THE BIG WATER</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> is the big water, Dick!” said Roger,
in the ear of his cousin, as he chanced to peer
through a narrow opening in the dense woods
beyond.</p>

<p>“And the chief has called a halt, which looks
as though we were not to go any further just
now,” Dick added.</p>

<p>They could catch a glimpse of what looked like
an inland sea. The wind was raising whitecaps
on the tops of the waves, as they rolled past
toward the south. As far as the eye could
reach the same broad expanse of clear crystal
water lay. The Indians did well to call it the
“big water,” though to-day it is marked on the
map as Yellowstone Lake.</p>

<p>A spy was sent out while the remainder of the
party remained in hiding. This was about
an hour from sundown. He came back as the
last glow was fading in the western sky, and
there was a consultation between the chief and
his leading warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Try to find out how the land lies, and what
the plan of campaign will be,” Dick told Mayhew.</p>

<p>The guide returned presently with all the information
they required.</p>

<p>“As near as I can tell,” he explained to the
boys, “the spy brings in the news that the
Blackfeet have mostly departed, and only the
four Frenchmen are left in the camp.”</p>

<p>“But I hope they have left Jasper behind
also,” exclaimed Roger, taking fresh alarm.
“You remember we were told by Lascelles that
he meant to try to get the Indians to carry
him far away to their village, and either adopt
him into the tribe, or else burn him at the
stake.”</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy on that score,” Mayhew
assured him.</p>

<p>“Then he is still in the camp?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, the spy saw him there, tied to a tree,”
Mayhew continued. “One of the Frenchmen
gave him a kick in passing, like the coward that
he is. I used to believe the French were gentlemen,
but my opinion has changed.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you must not judge all Frenchmen by
these rascals,” said Dick. “They are of the
bad kind. Perhaps Jasper will be glad of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
chance to return that kick with interest before
sun-up.”</p>

<p>“And if he doesn’t, I will!” asserted Roger,
impulsively, for he hated a coward and a bully
above all things.</p>

<p>“What does Beaver Tail mean to do?” Dick
asked.</p>

<p>“I think his first act will be to send the spy
back again, so as to keep track of what is going
on in the French camp,” Mayhew told him.
“Then at a later hour all of us will creep over
and surround the place. Any Blackfeet who
may be found are apt to be given a short shrift,
because they are the mortal foes of the Sioux;
but I do not believe the traders will be harmed,
unless they should be unwise enough to shoot
one of Beaver Tail’s warriors.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Dick saw the same skillful
scout go forth, and he knew that Mayhew had
guessed the truth when he said a close watch
was to be kept over the camp on the lake shore.</p>

<p>In good time the signal would be given for
the general advance. Until then, all of them
must possess their souls in patience. As the
cold of the night increased it was likely to prove
no laughing matter, since they were unprovided
with blankets, and dared not build a fire. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with success so close to their hands, the pioneer
boys felt that they could put up with almost
anything.</p>

<p>How slowly the time passed, in spite of all
these brave resolutions! Roger found it necessary
several times to get up and, as noiselessly
as possible, thresh his arms around him, so as
to start his stagnant blood into renewed circulation.
Had it not been for this expedient he
believed he would be unable to respond when
finally the signal was given to move on.</p>

<p>When it appeared to Roger that many hours
must have passed, he was elated to discover
that the chief, Beaver Tail, had begun to show
signs of life. He had been sitting like a block
of stone, simply casting a look up at the stars
occasionally, as though one of the heavenly
bodies must reach a certain altitude before the
time could be reckoned as up.</p>

<p>This must have been a signal to the others,
for immediately each warrior was on his moccasined
feet, and on every side bows could be
seen being strung in readiness for twanging,
while quivers of arrows were fastened over the
left shoulder of each soft-footed brave.</p>

<p>Once the expedition was in motion, the chill
soon left Roger’s body. In its place he experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
a gratifying warmth that must have
started through the increased pumping of his
youthful heart due to excitement.</p>

<p>The boys found as they advanced that the
crafty Sioux chief had made as complete arrangements
as any war captain could have done.
He had divided his force into three sections of
about equal numbers. One of these was sent
ahead, and it was easy to surmise that the duty
of these warriors was to proceed to the further
extremity of the Frenchmen’s camp, so as to cut
off escape from that quarter.</p>

<p>A second lot could come up from the rear,
while those with whom the palefaces and Beaver
Tail himself were associated advanced along the
shore of the lake, and expected to reach the
vicinity of the camp in that way.</p>

<p>The boys had never gazed upon a body of
water anything like the size of that lake, though
accustomed to the big Missouri River in flood-time,
when it was miles from shore to shore.
Once they had cruised down to the Mississippi
in company with Roger’s father, Sandy Armstrong,
who had built a big canoe and wanted
to revisit the place where, as a lad, he had had
a temporary home.</p>

<p>Seen in the sheen of the starlight, the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
looked as though it might be an ocean in itself,
for no further shore was visible. Roger wondered
if this was what the sea resembled, and if
he and Dick would really be permitted to continue
on with the explorers, cross the rocky
range of mountains, and finally bring up on the
golden strand of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>But there was a glimmering light close by,
which he surmised was a smoldering fire in the
French traders’ camp. Carefully they continued
to creep forward. It gave Roger a thrill
to realize that he was in the company of savages
such as his father and grandfather had fought
in the years gone by; but who were now their
best of friends. What wonderful stories he
and Dick would have to tell should they live
through all these manifold perils to return
safely home, and resume their old places at the
domestic fireside.</p>

<p>Both boys were secretly hoping that Lascelles
and his compatriots would not be so foolhardy
as to attempt to resist. Bad as these men were,
the boys did not wish to see them butchered, as
they undoubtedly would be should they fire on
the Sioux, or even wound one of Beaver Tail’s
warriors.</p>

<p>As for any stray Blackfeet who may have remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
in camp while the main body was off
somewhere, if they got in the way of the Sioux
arrows or tomahawks that was their lookout;
the boys could not be expected to include them
in the scheme of general amnesty.</p>

<p>The attack was not to be started until certain
signals announced that all the detachments had
reached the positions assigned to them by the
chief. When he heard the howl of a wolf given
with a certain little twist at the finish, and then
also caught the cry of the screech-owl, he would
feel assured that nothing remained to be done
but order a concerted assault.</p>

<p>Indians have always had a certain set plan
for their surprises. No matter how slyly they
crept up on blockhouse or camp or border fort,
when a certain time arrived they felt it was absolutely
necessary to break out in ferocious yells.
No doubt this was done partly to give freedom
to their pent-up feelings, and, at the same time,
add to the alarm of those whom they were attacking.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger knew this fact. They had
had some little experience themselves in connection
with Indians. Besides this, they had heard
innumerable stories from Grandfather David
concerning those days along the Ohio, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
tribes from the Great Lakes to the southern
border of Kentucky were all on the warpath, and
seeking day and night to destroy the hardy
pioneers.</p>

<p>This being the case, neither of the lads felt
any surprise when there arose a series of the
most dreadful yells. The warriors whom they
accompanied added to the din with all their
might, at the same time springing forward and
running in the direction of the near by camp.</p>

<p>From every quarter arose that deafening
clamor. It must have struck terror to the
hearts of the Frenchmen, even though they may
have fancied that they were friendly with all
the tribes of the far Northwest, because of their
dealings in the matter of buying the stores of
pelts collected by the red men.</p>

<p>There was nothing for the boys to do but
keep company with the braves as they thus
closed in on the surrounded camp. Already
they could see signs of tremendous excitement in
that quarter, as the inmates, alarmed by the
clamor of many tongues, turned this way and
that, hardly knowing whether to run, or else
raise up their hands in token of submission.</p>

<p>Several dusky figures were discovered by the
light of the fire darting into the thickets close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the camp. These must be the few Blackfoot
braves who, for some reason, had been left behind.
They knew there would be no mercy for
them at the hands of their mortal foes, the
Sioux, and on that account they preferred taking
their chances in the brush and half-darkness.</p>

<p>Had it not been for that horrid din, perhaps
the boys might have caught the sharp twang of
bowstrings; they might also have heard the
death cries of those who met the flight of those
swiftly-driven arrows, with their tips of jagged
flint.</p>

<p>Just then it mattered nothing to Dick and
Roger whether any of the Blackfeet managed
to run the gauntlet and escape or not; their
thoughts were all taken up with the hope and
expectation of finding that one for whom they
had long sought, Jasper Williams, whose signature
at the bottom of a new document would
mean so much to the folks at home.</p>

<p>As they entered the camp they saw a cluster
of figures standing with fear-blanched faces.
The flickering firelight showed the boys that
Lascelles was there, and the smooth-faced young
man, cowering at his side, must be his son,
Alexis, whom accounts reported as being as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
great a rascal as his father. Besides, there
were two more of the traders.</p>

<p>At sight of the boys whom he had so greatly
wronged Lascelles cried out something. Neither
of them could exactly understand its nature;
but Dick fancied the cowardly Frenchman
must be pleading with them to have his life
spared.</p>

<p>“Hold up your hands, and they may not harm
you; but under no conditions try to run away
or you are dead men!” was what he flung out
at them as he ran past.</p>

<p>Roger was at his heels. The guide, with wonderful
good sense, gave the fire a little kick in
passing, which had the effect of starting up
quite a bright blaze. By the aid of this light they
could see what was going on.</p>

<p>Already a number of the Sioux had entered
the camp. Their appearance, with flourishing
hatchets and knives, doubtless chilled the blood
of the Frenchmen, knowing as they now did that
these braves of Running Elk must be on the
most friendly terms with Dick and Roger Armstrong.</p>

<p>Dick looked further. It was, however, the
keen-eyed Roger who chanced to be the first to
discover what they were searching for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“This way, Dick; here he is, tied to this
tree!” he cried.</p>

<p>As Dick leaped after him he saw that there
was indeed some one bound fast to a tree, a
white man at that; and the firelight disclosed the
fact that it was Jasper Williams.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>A WELL WON VICTORY—CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> astonishment of Jasper Williams was
apparent as he saw Dick and Roger Armstrong
before him. Up to that time he had supposed
the attack to be simply one of those ordinary
Indian surprises to be expected when white men
are hunting on ground that the tribes of the
Northwest claimed as their own territory.</p>

<p>“Saving me seems to be getting quite a habit
with you lads,” he told them, as his bonds were
hurriedly severed, and he could grasp a hand
of each. “How did the news reach camp; and
what made the captain allow you to start out
almost alone into this heathen land in order to
rescue me?”</p>

<p>Dick quickly informed him concerning the reason
for their presence.</p>

<p>“We did not dream that you were in trouble,”
he said. “Mayhew, who was taking the document
to our people down on the Missouri, was
robbed of the paper. He came back to the camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to let us know; and we could see the fine hand of
that French trader over there back of it.”</p>

<p>“François Lascelles!” cried the hunter, as a
look of understanding crossed his rugged features.
“Now I begin to see what it all means.
He was afraid you would get another signature
from me, and to block the game he had me taken
prisoner by the Blackfeet. Why,” he added,
in a burst of anger, “they even threatened to
carry me off to their village and make me teach
their squaws how white women sew and bake
bread, and all such civilized ways!”</p>

<p>“We immediately started out to overtake
you,” continued Dick, “and Mayhew insisted
on being one of our party. What strange adventures
we have met with you shall hear about
another time; for I take it that you do not mean
after this to head any further into such a terrible
country?”</p>

<p>Williams shrugged his broad shoulders, and
made a wry face.</p>

<p>“I suppose, lads, I would be a fool to try it,
since my comrades deserted me,” he told them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Roger, “we met them on the
way, and both Hardy and Mordaunt vowed nothing
could tempt them to go a step further.
What with the working of the Evil Spirit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the danger from hostile reds, they had had
enough.”</p>

<p>“We are glad to hear you say such a sensible
thing,” Dick added, “because this does not
seem like a white man’s country. Only for our
good luck in meeting these friendly Sioux, who
come from the village of Running Elk, we might
have had a much harder time in getting you
free. But it is all right now!”</p>

<p>“The sooner we start back to the camp the
better I will be pleased,” Williams admitted.
“Then there’s that document we ought to have
on its way. What will you do with the Frenchmen?”</p>

<p>“If we let them go free now,” affirmed Roger,
“no matter how they give us their solemn word
of honor, I believe Lascelles would try to intercept
our messenger again.”</p>

<p>“You are right about that, son,” said Williams,
warmly. “Better let the Indians knock
them on the head, and have done with it. They
surely deserve little mercy at your hands.”</p>

<p>Dick, however, could not agree to such a thing.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, firmly, “if Beaver Tail will
agree to take them to camp with us, I believe
Captain Lewis will hold them as hostages until
Mayhew has had time to get so far along on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
his journey east that he can not be headed again.
After that the Frenchmen might be turned
loose.”</p>

<p>Between Williams and Mayhew this was explained
to Beaver Tail, who agreed. Nothing
was said about a reward, but Dick had already
made up his mind that he would endeavor to
induce the two captains in charge of the exploring
party to deal generously with the Sioux in
this respect.</p>

<p>“It will not be thrown away, either,” he told
Williams, “because to have Running Elk and his
tribe friendly with us might mean much for the
success of our trip when spring comes.”</p>

<p>Naturally Lascelles and his comrades were
very much concerned as to what their fate was
going to be. When they heard what Dick had
to say they seemed rather pleased, though the
old trader frowned, and muttered to himself
from time to time, as though he did not like the
idea of being frustrated in his cherished scheme.</p>

<p>There was apparently no help for it, unless
he wished to try to escape, when the chances
were he would be quickly hunted down and lose
his scalp to the Sioux.</p>

<p>Accordingly a start was made for the camp,
the entire band of Indians accompanying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
boys and the Frenchmen. During that weary
march the old trader was given an opportunity
of learning about the character of the two lads
whom he had been pursuing so heartlessly, with
the intention of robbing their parents of the
property that he claimed through a flaw in the
title.</p>

<p>Whether this knowledge did him any good or
not it would be impossible to say. He was too
old to change his ways of life, and, while openly
protesting to have seen a light, so that he would
no longer try to injure the Armstrongs, Dick
and Roger put little faith in his repentance.</p>

<p>When finally the camp was reached the prisoners
were handed over to the care of some of
the soldiers accompanying the expedition, who
were charged with the task of seeing that none
of them escaped.</p>

<p>Jasper Williams readily signed another document
which Captain Lewis himself arranged,
and both the leaders of the expedition put their
names down as witnesses. Then Mayhew
started once more for the lower Missouri. The
other two messengers had agreed to wait at a
certain place for him to join them; and he believed
he still had ample time to arrive before
the specified time would be up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>When the two boys waved him farewell they
felt that a great load had been taken from their
shoulders.</p>

<p>“This time there should be nothing to prevent
him from reaching our homes and delivering
the precious paper, besides our letters,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“Something seems to tell me he will do it,”
added Roger, “and so I have decided not to
let it worry me any longer. We will keep Lascelles
and his son here for some weeks, so that
they will be powerless to catch up with Mayhew,
even if they wished to try it. And Beaver
Tail seemed greatly pleased with the generous
way Captain Lewis treated him, too, so we have
made good friends of the Sioux.”</p>

<p>“He gave the chief a gun and some ammunition,”
remarked Dick. “He was as pleased
with it as a child would be with a new toy. And
every brave also received something to show
that we wanted them to be our friends. But the
dinner we gave them did not seem to reach the
right spot. I saw more than one slyly throw the
tea away when they thought no one was looking.”</p>

<p>“They will stick to roast dog as a feast dish,”
laughed Roger. “I was afraid at one time there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
might be trouble between the Mandans and the
Sioux, for they are old rivals of the chase and
the warpath. But Captain Lewis managed to
patch up a truce that may last while we are here,
at any rate, even if the old warfare breaks out
again afterwards.”</p>

<p>“It took a good deal of talk, though,” suggested
Roger, “to induce the Mandans to hide
those old Sioux scalps they had swinging about
their teepees. If the braves of Running Elk had
glimpsed those nothing could have kept them
from making trouble. But it is simply wonderful
what power Captain Lewis has over men.”</p>

<p>“If we ever do set eyes on the great ocean
that lies far beyond the range of rocky mountains,”
Dick affirmed, “it will be owing mostly
to the cleverness of the President’s private secretary.”</p>

<p>History has recorded the facts, and the young
pioneer in stating his opinion was only saying
what other men have conceded.</p>

<p>A few days after Mayhew left the camp, well
provisioned and armed for his dangerous trip
over the back trail, winter set in in earnest.
The boys were well satisfied to be so comfortably
housed and among friends, instead of wandering
amidst those strange scenes of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
they never seemed to tire of talking, where the
earth appeared to be on fire deep down under
the outer crust, and continually spouted those
colossal streams of steaming water.</p>

<p>The four Frenchmen were kept prisoners until
several weeks had elapsed, and then allowed
to go. They had a <i>cache</i> somewhere, they admitted,
with an abundance of ammunition as
well as other supplies, so there was little fear
of their perishing in the severity of the winter
weather.</p>

<p>As the days and weeks drifted along Dick and
Roger carried out many of their little plans.
They hunted when the weather admitted, and accompanied
Jasper Williams on trapping jaunts
that covered several days. They also had intercourse
with the peculiar Mandan Indians, and
learned a multitude of interesting things connected
with the tribe called the “White Indians,”
a race which has always been a mystery
to historians.</p>

<p>As the long winter drew near a close the boys
began to feel their pulses thrill in anticipation
of being once more on the move with their faces
turned toward the magical setting sun.</p>

<p>The talk around the fires was all of the wonders
that still awaited them beyond the chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of mountains of which they heard so much.
Every scrap of information was garnered and
repeated. Captain Lewis lost no opportunity to
learn new facts, or rumors concerning what
they might expect to meet in their further advance
into the country which up to then had
never known the impression of a white man’s
foot.</p>

<p>It can be easily understood, then, that as the
snows began to melt with the gradual increase of
the sun’s warmth in the early spring, preparations
were feverishly undertaken for a start.
And in that camp there was none more deeply
interested in the final outcome than were our
two pioneer boys.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll see some wonderful sights,”
said Roger.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the answer Dick made.</p>

<p>How the forward march into the Great Unknown
was resumed, and what adventures fell
to the lot of our young heroes, will be related in
the next volume of this series, to be called “The
Pioneer Boys of the Columbia”; but, come what
may, it is not likely that they will witness anything
more wonderful than the marvels they encountered
in the territory of the Yellowstone.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_1"></a><a href="#Note_1r">Note 1</a> (<a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>)</span></h3>

<p>When, in 1803, the new Republic purchased from
France for fifteen million dollars what was then
known as the territory of Louisiana, the United States
extended its boundaries toward the unknown West
where it was believed a mighty range of mountains
divided the continent, while far beyond lay the Pacific
Ocean. The territory included practically what is
now covered by the States of Montana, North and
South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Indian Territory, and part of
Colorado.</p>

<p>President Jefferson wished to aid the settlers along
the Mississippi, who wanted more room for expansion
toward the setting sun, and accordingly, on his recommendation,
Congress authorized the sending of an exploring
expedition to ascertain what lay beyond the
limits of the new land, and, if possible, to go all the
way to the ocean.</p>

<p>Captain Meriwether Lewis, the President’s private
secretary, together with Captain William Clark, was
placed in charge of the expedition, which started from
St. Louis early in 1804. It consisted of nine young
Kentuckians, fourteen United States soldiers, two
French voyageurs to serve as interpreters among the
Indians whom they expected to encounter, and a black
servant for Captain Clark. Some frontiersmen also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
joined them before they left the last trading post. On
May 24th this little expedition left the mouth of the
Missouri, and plunged into the then unknown wilderness,
not knowing whether a single soul of the party
would ever live to come back again with a record of
the wonders they had seen, and the perils they had
encountered.</p>

<p>History tells us that they wintered at the Mandan
village near the headwaters of the Missouri and that
strange river which the Indians called Yellowstone, on
account of the predominating color along its banks.
The following spring the Lewis and Clark expedition
continued on its way, reaching the Columbia River,
and following it down until, at its mouth, they beheld
the goal of all their hopes, the glorious ocean that lay
bathed in the glow of the setting sun.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_2"></a><a href="#Note_2r">Note 2</a> (<a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>)</span></h3>

<p>In those days, when the Indians of the Northwest
did not have the Great White Father at Washington
to supply them with rations and fresh beef, it was customary
for the various tribes to participate in annual
fall hunts, so that sufficient meat might be procured
to last them through the long, cold winters.</p>

<p>Sometimes they went after buffalo, which at that
day were to be found in immense herds, and often the
most wanton destruction was indulged in, traps being
laid whereby the great animals were driven by hundreds
over some precipice, so that the Indians hardly
bothered taking anything but the tongues of their
victims, which they cured by drying in the smoke of
their fires. In spite of this slaughter the herds continued
to increase until modern man, with his repeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
rifle, made his appearance, at the time the first
railroad was being built across the continent, when
they quickly reached the point of practical extermination.</p>

<p>More often the meat obtained in these fall hunts
was venison. This the Indians cured by drying in the
sun. Thus prepared, it would keep for any length of
time, if not allowed to get wet. It is not the nicest
food an epicure might select, being dark-looking, and
often as hard as flint; but pemmican, as this dried
venison is called, can be made into a palatable dish
when properly cooked.</p>

<p>When an Indian was sent on a trip of perhaps two
hundred miles, to take a message to another tribe, he
would simply carry along with him in his pouch a
handful of this pemmican, which would serve him as a
means of sustenance throughout his long journey,
washed down with an occasional drink from some
spring that he would discover on the trail.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_3"></a><a href="#Note_3r">Note 3</a> (<a href="#Page_128">page 128</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Probably the giant geyser which performed such a
splendid service for our two young heroes was the
one known for many years as Old Faithful, from the
fact that, while other geysers in Yellowstone Park
may seem grander on occasion, they are often erratic
in their flow, and not to be depended on. Old Faithful
has often been described, and is an object of such
general interest among the visitors to the National
Park that a large hotel has been built so close that one
can sit in an easy-chair within a few hundred yards,
and view its spectacular upheaval.</p>

<p>It seems to come every sixty-five minutes, to a dot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and the great white column rises with a roar from one
to two hundred feet into the air, continuing for possibly
the space of five minutes. New beauties are to be
discovered with almost every eruption, according to
the weather, and the hour of the day or night. Sunrise,
sunset, moonlight sway the great steaming column
into a thousand fantastic forms. When the geyser is
quiet one may approach the crater, an oblong opening
about two by six feet, with a quiet pool of crystal
water.</p>

<p>Some say the deposits around the crater indicate an
age of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years.
When Columbus discovered America this great column
played at regular intervals in the primal solitude;
when Lief Erickson landed it was unspeakably old,
but glorious as ever; when Christ was on earth its
strange beauty fell on the eye of the infrequent savage
who gazed on it with superstitious awe; long before
the reputed date of creation it played and coruscated
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that those, who stop to think, gaze
with wonder on Old Faithful and that the Indians, at
the time the Lewis and Clark expedition crossed the
continent, held it in awe and reverence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_4"></a><a href="#Note_4r">Note 4</a> (<a href="#Page_162">page 162</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The grizzly bear has never been found east of a
certain line marked by spurs of the mighty Rocky
Mountains. At the time the Lewis and Clark expedition
penetrated the wilderness lying between the
settlements along the lower Missouri and the far distant
Coast Range of mountains, in what is now known
as California, very little was known of this most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
terrible of all the wild animals native to North America;
indeed, some big game hunters put the grizzly
ahead of the African lion or the tiger of the Indian
jungle so far as ferocity and toughness goes.</p>

<p>Vague stories drifted to the ears of white hunters
about a monster bear which terrified the red men of
the West. They had even seen the claws strung
around the neck of some chief who had won his high
position after having killed one of these fearful creatures
in a hand-to-hand fight.</p>

<p>When the explorers finally returned to civilization
they brought with them the most amazing stories of
things they had seen; but undoubtedly nothing surpassed
their descriptions of the grizzly bear’s ten lives,
and the fearful strength which the animal possessed.</p>

<p>In these modern days of soft-nosed bullets, and the
exploding kind that do such fearful execution upon
striking the game, it may not be so difficult to bring
down old “Eph,” as Western men call the grizzly;
but a score or more of years ago men declared that
they had known such an animal to be hit with twenty
shots, and yet seem to mind his wounds no more than
if they were flea-bites.</p>

<p>It can be seen, then, that, in slaying a grizzly, Dick
and his cousin Roger were really accomplishing what
in those days was a stupendous feat. Their success
must be laid partly to good luck, and the fact that they
were able to send their lead to a vital spot. Ordinary
wounds will have little or no effect upon a tough
grizzly, save to further enrage the beast, and make him
more fierce than ever.</p>

<p>Unless they are heavily armed, or can gain the
shelter of a convenient tree, wise hunters usually let
such a dangerous animal severely alone when coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
unexpectedly upon him in the rocky canyons where he
loves to prowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_5"></a><a href="#Note_5r">Note 5</a> (<a href="#Page_181">page 181</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The first real intimation the world received concerning
the wonders of what is now Yellowstone Park can
be said to have come through the experiences of a
trapper by the name of Colter. He was made prisoner
by the hostile Blackfeet in the early part of the nineteenth
century, and, after being tortured by them,
managed to escape. When he afterwards reached
civilization he had some marvelous tales to tell about a
land of steaming pools; of springs of boiling water,
that at intervals shot hundreds of feet into the air; of
seething cauldrons of pitch; of strange lakes and
rivers; as well as of rocks and clay that bore the diversified
colors of the rainbow. Of course, his rough
friends laughed at his stories, and gave them little
credence. Indeed, it was believed that the sufferings
of the trapper had made him somewhat light in the
head. They treated his accounts with derision, and
classed the tales with those of Gulliver and Munchausen.
But, in later years, everything Colter had told
was amply verified, showing that he had actually been
in the region now known as Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>It was not until 1869 that a well-equipped prospecting
party was sent out by private enterprise to ascertain
the truth about this supposedly mythical region
of awe-inspiring wonders. Thirty-six days were spent
on the trip, and the party saw such amazing things
that, as the account tells us, some of them “were unwilling
on their return to risk their reputation for
veracity by relating the wonders of that unequaled
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>To-day, the tourist is taken into the Park and shown
everything that is worth seeing with the least degree
of discomfort. And there is nothing in the Old
World that can at all compare with the natural wonders
to be found on the great Government Reservation,
the lake itself being the gem of them all, for it covers
something like one hundred and fifty square miles,
and is as clear as crystal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_6"></a><a href="#Note_6r">Note 6</a> (<a href="#Page_191">page 191</a>)</span></h3>

<p>As a rule the Indians of the Great Northwest seemed
to avoid the region now known as Yellowstone Park,
even though it abounded in game, because of superstitious
fears connected with the mysterious working
of the spouting geysers, which they believed to be the
evidence of the Evil One opposed to the Good Manitou.
Occasionally the Blackfeet or the Crows invaded the
borders when in need of fresh meat. Some lodges of
a fragment of the Snake Indians have been found, a
miserable tribe known as Sheep-eaters; but the powerful
Sioux, the Mandans, and the Nez Perces tribes
avoided the district as though it were truly accursed.</p>

<p>The most important Indian trail in the Park was
that known as the Great Bannock Trail. It extended
from Henry Lake across the Gallatin Range to Mammoth
Hot Springs, where it was joined by another
coming up the valley of the Gardiner. Thence it led
across the Black-tail Deer plateau to the ford above
Tower Falls; thence up the Lamor Valley, forking at
Soda Butte, and reaching the Bighorn Valley by way
of Clark’s Falls and the Stinking-water River. The
trail was certainly a very ancient and much traveled
one. It had become a deep furrow in the grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
slopes, and is still distinctly visible in places, though
unused for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Arrows and spear heads have been discovered in
considerable numbers. Some of the early explorers
also found more recent and perishable evidence of the
presence of Indians in the Park in the shape of rude
wick-e-ups, brush enclosures, and similar contrivances
of the Sheep-killers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_7"></a><a href="#Note_7r">Note 7</a> (<a href="#Page_196">page 196</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Of all the tribes west of the Mississippi, even including
the warlike Sioux, none gave the venturesome
paleface adventurers who wandered into that country
more trouble than the Blackfoot Indians. Like the
Flatheads, and some other tribes, they had their main
villages far up amidst the pine-clad mountains where
enemies could hardly reach them without long and
dangerous journeys. From these eyries they were accustomed
to sally forth, either on some grand hunt for
a winter’s supply of meat, or else to strike a sudden
blow at some tribe with which they were at war.</p>

<p>When game grew scarce in their customary hunting
grounds, some of these bold braves were in the
habit of taking longer hunts, and had frequently approached
the border of the Land of Wonders. As a
rule they avoided the country of the spouting geysers,
because they believed an Evil Spirit dwelt there.</p>

<p>The habits of these Indians differed from those of
the Mandans, because they were by nature of a much
wilder disposition, utterly untamable. To this day
the remnants of the old Blackfoot tribe are not to be
compared with other civilized aborigines who have
taken to the plow and the cottage. The Mandans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
themselves suffered so severely from smallpox, introduced
into the tribe through connection with the
whites, that long years ago they became extinct.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_8"></a><a href="#Note_8r">Note 8</a> (<a href="#Page_221">page 221</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The usual medicine man of all the Indian tribes of
North America in the days of the pioneers was as big
a humbug as could be imagined. He usually held his
position through craftiness, and the ability to make
the tribe believe that he was in direct communication
with the Great Spirit or Manitou. It was therefore
a matter of some moment for the native doctor
to “make good” when he had promised that victory
would crown the efforts of the warriors going forth to
battle, or otherwise his life might pay the penalty.</p>

<p>When it came to treating disease he seldom gave
even the commonest herbs, rather trusting to incantations
in order to frighten off the evil thing that had
fastened on the sick person. Thus tomtoms were
beaten, chants given, and the medicine man himself
would perform a weird dance around the sick one,
making music to accompany his gesticulations by rattling
gourds in which stones had been slipped, jingling
the metal ornaments on his apparel, and in every
imaginable way trying to “conjure” the maker of the
spell that had been laid upon the afflicted one.</p>

<p>Sometimes the invalid got well in spite of everything,
and great was the jubilation of the tribe; on
the other hand if death came and took a victim it was
easy for the medicine man to find some excuse.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Blackfoot chief, Black Otter, may have
seen white doctors cure their patients by giving them
medicine; or else learned of it through intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
with French traders, such as Lascelles. However that
might be, it was not so very singular for some of his
braves to have become afflicted with the same desire
to be treated by a paleface medicine man. This, then,
would account for the eagerness with which those
who had received wounds in the affray between the
Blackfeet and the invaders of the Enchanted Land
agreed to let young Dick Armstrong attend to their
hurts. Deep down in their hearts they must have
realized that the way of the palefaces was much superior
to the crude methods in vogue with their native
medicine man.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_9"></a><a href="#Note_9r">Note 9</a> (<a href="#Page_246">page 246</a>)</span></h3>

<p>This incident of an Indian’s gratitude is not of an
unusual character. The history of early pioneer days
shows many such. The red men were savage and cruel
fighters, crafty, and not to be trusted in many ways;
but they possessed several noble characteristics that
will always stand out boldly when the good and bad
are contrasted.</p>

<p>Many instances are on record which prove that the
Indian could be grateful for benefits bestowed, though
he might sooner choose to die than ask a favor.</p>

<p>The brave whose wounded shoulder Dick had so
skillfully treated evidently saw no reason why he
should call out and alarm the camp when he discovered
the paleface boys escaping. He probably
had no special liking for the French trader, and it was
Lascelles who seemed to be most concerned in the keeping
of the two white lads. Perhaps, even, he had some
reason to dislike the trader; or he may have felt, deep
down in his heart, a secret admiration for the boys
who could thus hoodwink a dozen Blackfoot braves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_10"></a><a href="#Note_10r">Note 10</a> (<a href="#Page_308">page 308</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The Sioux proper, known among themselves and by
other Indian tribes as Dacotahs, were originally one of
the most extensively diffused nations of the Great
West. From the Upper Mississippi, where they mingled
with the northern race of Chippewas, to the Missouri,
and far in the Northwest toward the country of
the Blackfeet, the tribes of this family occupied the
boundless prairie.</p>

<p>It was in the country of the Sioux, on a high ridge
separating the head-waters of the St. Peter’s from the
Missouri, that the far-famed quarry of red pipestone
lay. It was originally deemed a neutral ground
where hostile tribes from far and near might resort
to secure a supply of this all-essential want of the
Indian, for all their pipes were made of this peculiar
hard clay.</p>

<p>To use the stone for any other purposes was to the
Indians an act of sacrilege. They looked upon it as
priceless <i>medicine</i>. At a meeting of chiefs which Mr.
Catlin, the historical writer, attended near this quarry
many years ago he heard some remarkable expressions
used. “You see,” said one chief, holding a pipe close
to his arm, “this pipe is part of our own flesh.”
Another said: “If the white man takes away a piece
of the red pipestone, it is a hole in our flesh, and the
blood will always run.” A third expressed his feelings
in a still more remarkable way: “We love to
go to the Pipe-Stone, and get a piece for our pipes;
but we ask the Great Spirit first. If the white men
go to it they will take it out, and not fill up the holes
again and the Great Spirit will be offended.”</p>

<p>Besides the Sioux there were to be found at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in this region the Flatheads, the Ojibbeways, the Assinaboias,
the Crows, the Blackfeet, and several lesser
tribes. Among them there was almost constant warfare.
While the Blackfeet and others had plenty of
game in their own lands, they were now and then
seized with a desire to dare the anger of the Sioux
and hunt the buffalo over the territory claimed as
their preserves by the latter. And many fierce battles
took place because of this belligerency.</p>
